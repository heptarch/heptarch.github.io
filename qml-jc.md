<h1>QML journal club</h1>

This the informal home page for Xanadu's quantum machine learning
journal club (QMLJC).
We will be reading through Dan Roberts and Sho Yaida's textbook,
[*The Principles of Deep Learning Theory*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10165.pdf).
The hope is that, by grokking a physics-informed approach to classical
ML, we can see what, if anything, transfers to quantum ML.
Here is the upcoming schedule:

| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ambrosia | gala | red delicious |
| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |
| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |
