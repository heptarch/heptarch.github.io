<h1>QML journal club</h1>

This is the informal home page for Xanadu's quantum machine learning
journal club (QMLJC).
We will be reading through Dan Roberts and Sho Yaida's textbook,
[*The Principles of Deep Learning Theory*](https://deeplearningtheory.com/).
The hope is that, by grokking a physics-informed approach to classical
ML, we can see what, if anything, transfers to quantum ML.
Here is the upcoming schedule:

| Date              | Material            | Host                 | Scribe        |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Jan 11, 2024 | Admin               | David Wakeham | David Wakeham |
| Jan 18, 2024 | [ยง0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10165.pdf) | TBA           | TBA           |
