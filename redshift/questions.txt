      <li>You have a pile of warm metal shavings in the shape of a
      cone. Discuss.</li><br>
      
      <li>How can a two-level quantum system be used to navigate
      around a star? Describe the underlying principles. </li><br>

      <li>Suppose intelligent life evolves from
    topologically robust quantum matter. Describe its social
    structure and language.</li><br>
    
      <li>George Box said "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
    Is this a model?</li><br>
    
      <li>Someone gives you a hot rock. Design a simple language 
      called <tt>rock</tt> (and
      optionally a compiler) for computing using physical operations on
      the rock.</li><br>

      <li>In the sewer beneath the Prague Orloj is a locked
      box. What's inside? </li><br>
      
      <li>Create a lab of autonomous AI agents
  using an organizational/research philosophy of your own devising. Report
  their most interesting finding. Do you think your organizational
  principles helped?</li><br>

      <li>Explain how a quantum spin could be used to navigate
      around a star.</li>

  <li>Is it surprising that time is one-dimensional?</li><br>
  
      <li>Formulate evolution as a physico-mathematical

            <p>We are currently developing three pilot
	    projects: <b>StateCraft</b>,
	    <b>Invisible Ink</b> and <b>Paχ</b>. These lie in the overlapping
	    fields of quantum computing, AI safety, and
	    cryptography, where we hope to build a critical mass of
	    expertise, along with the network effects that come with
	    it. Read more <a href="#projects">below</a>.</p>
