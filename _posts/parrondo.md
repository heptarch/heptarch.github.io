**November 9, 2022.** *I'll explain what Parrondo's paradox is, why it
  isn't a paradox, a quantum analogue, and how it's connected to
  Maxwell's demon.*

#### Introduction

Sometimes, alternating between two losing strategies becomes a winning
strategy. This is called *Parrondo's paradox*. As we'll see
below, it isn't much of a paradox, but it is interesting.
A simple illustration is a ball rolling around some hills. Maybe the
ball is hot, and has the tendency to jump randomly, but it's average
behaviour is easy to understand.
