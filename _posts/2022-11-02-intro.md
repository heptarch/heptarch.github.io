**November 2, 2022.** *A quick introduction.*

"Saxifrage" means "stone breaker". These tiny, five-petalled
flowers are the toughest and most northernmost growing plants on
earth. By virtue of their pattern of growth, they split rocks and
flourish in unlikely places; they are in the business of
[viriditas](https://blog.saxifrage.one/about/).

This website is a place for me to collect my own thoughts on, and
attempts at, viriditas. It's a place I'll try to ask (and
answer) stupid questions, not be boring, wonder, celebrate, and if I'm
lucky, change reality in tough places. Like the little purple flowers.
