**November 2, 2022.** *A quick introduction.*

<div>
<center><br>
Today, like every other day, we wake up empty
and frightened.<br>
Donâ€™t open the door to the study and begin reading. <br>
Take down a musical instrument.<br>
<br>

Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>
There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

"Saxifrage" means "stone breaker". These tiny, five-petalled
flowers are the toughest and most northernmost growing plants on
earth. By virtue of their pattern of growth, they split rocks and
flourish in unlikely places; they are in the business of
[viriditas](https://blog.saxifrage.one/about/).


This website is a place for me to collect my own thoughts on, and
attempts at, viriditas. It's a place where I'll try to ask (and
answer) stupid questions, not be boring, wonder, celebrate, and if I'm
lucky, change reality in tough places. Like the little purple flowers.
