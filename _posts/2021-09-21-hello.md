**September 22, 2021.** *This post is the bottle of champagne smashed against the hull of a
new ship. I christen thee* Saxifrage. *Expect adventures.*

Welcome! This blog will be a scratchpad for random technical
thoughts which may or may not have commercial/intellectual value,
going under the moniker of *Saxifrage*:
I'm not quite sure what *Saxifrage* is or where it's
headed. What I can guarantee, however, is a speculative,
seat-of-your-pants, swashbuckling adventure on the high seas of
interdimensional wizardry.
