This is the home page for Xanadu's quantum machine learning
journal club (QMLJC). We will be working through a textbook (or
textbooks) on classical ML in the hopes it will contribute to our
expertise in QML, offer new insights, and generally enhance our
quality of life.

Here is the schedule (to be populated):

| Date         | Material                | Guide         | Scribe        |
|--------------+-------------------------+---------------+---------------|
| [[week0][Jan 9]], 2024  | Admin, SVM: §1.1-2      | David Wakeham | David Wakeham |
| [[week1][Jan 16]], 2024 | ESL: §2.1-2.4           | TBA           | TBA           |
|--------------+-------------------------+---------------+---------------|

Notes on past meetings are in chronological order below.

* <<week0>> Admin
-----

*Reading*: None.

Based on popular accord, we'll be focusing on the classical
statistical approach to ML embodied in [[https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf][/Elements of Statistical Learning/]], and the
effective field theory paradigm of [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10165.pdf][/The Principles of Deep
Learning/]]. These are like the out-of-field examiner and the scary
departmental theorist at your viva. These foci will not stop us from being
eclectic, and dipping into resources on [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13478.pdf][/Geometric Deep Learning/]],
[[https://pzs.dstu.dp.ua/DataMining/svm/bibl/Support_Vector.pdf][/Support Vector Machines/]] or [[https://www.deeplearningbook.org/][/Deep Learning/]] proper, as time, interest, and chunking limits permit.

Each week we will have designated reading, optional readings (in
parentheses in the schedule), and a guide or guides who have agreed (or been
voluntold) to talk us through the readings. There will
also be a scribe to take notes
([[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html][~org mode~]] preferred, but anything [[https://pandoc.org/][~Pandoc~]] can handle is
acceptable).

Finally, to ensure it is not only the machines learning, we will try
to do a healthy number of homework problems. The precise number and
assignment mechanism will be determined collaboratively.

* <<week1>> Overview of supervised learning

*Reading*: [[SVM][SVM]]: §1.1-2; [[ESL][ESL]]: §2.1-2.4.
