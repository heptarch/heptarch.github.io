"Saxifrage" means "stone breaker". These tiny, five-petalled
flowers are the toughest, most northernmost growing plants on
earth.

#### Mission statement

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Look at the pattern this seashell makes. The dappled whorl, curving
inward to infinity. That's the shape of the universe itself. There's a
constant pressure, pushing toward pattern. A tendency in matter to
evolve into ever more complex forms. It's a kind of pattern gravity, a
holy greening power we call viriditas, and it is the driving force in
the cosmos. Life, you see. … And because we are alive, the universe
must be said to be alive. We are its consciousness as well as our
own. We rise out of the cosmos and we see its mesh of patterns, and it
strikes us as beautiful. And that feeling is the most important thing
in all the universe—its culmination, like the color of a flower at
first bloom on a wet morning. It’s a holy feeling, and our task in
this world is to do everything we can to foster it.

Some ground rules for viriditas:

- Flower beats rock.
- Ain't no stupid questions.
- Don't be boring.
- Truth = beauty = meta-patterns.
- Magician is a real job.
