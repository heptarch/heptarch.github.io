<!-- "Saxifrage" means "stone breaker". These tiny, five-petalled -->
<!-- flowers are the toughest and most northernmost growing plants on -->
<!-- earth. By virtue of their pattern of growth, they split rocks and -->
<!-- flourish in unlikely places; they are in the business of -->
<!-- viriditas.-->
