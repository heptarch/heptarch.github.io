Today, like every other day, we wake up empty
and frightened.<br>
Don’t open the door to the study and begin reading. <br>
Take down a musical instrument.<br><br>

Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>
There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

Bell Labs was a cool place. Over the course of a century, its researchers invented/discovered
lasers, the transistor, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, the Cosmic Microwave Background, electron diffraction, photovoltaic cells,
MOSFET, charge-coupled devices, optical fibres, `UNIX`, `C`, Grover search,
Shor's algorithm, among other innovations too numerous to name.
What made it special? Money, to begin with. Bell Labs operated
under the auspices of a state telecommunications monopoly, so no one had to hustle for
grants, venture capital, or quarterly revenue.

But lots of researchers
have security of funding and don't win a Nobel Prize or an IEEE
Medal. Money is only something you worry about when there isn't
enough.
Then again, good industrial research is expensive, and more money
means more talent, equipment, and time. But from a
quick survey of well-heeled Ivies and moonshot factories of Big Tech,
its clear that money is not enough to explain Bell Labs' success.
I think the special sauce was not material—the cash flow or the
personnel or the supply of oscilloscopes—but philosophical.

To illustrate, consider Mervin Kelly, director of research from 1936
to 1943 and president of Bell Labs from 1951 to 1959. Kelly played a pivotal (though not
Nobel-worthy) role in the invention of the transistor, and as
president, helped develop the laser and the solar cell.
He was a scientist-manager par excellence, but his views on managing
scientists would seem heretical now. Research was a "non-scheduled
area of work", so the scientists did not have to jump through the
corporate hoops of OKRs, deadlines, or progress reports.

No hustle, no crunch; just research.
The buildings were designed to facilitate disciplinary cross-talk,
stimulation, and focus. Kelly oversaw that alchemy as well. As he
put it: "We give much attention to the maintenance of an atmosphere of
freedom and an environment stimulating to scholarship and scientific
research interest. It is most important to limit their work to that of
research." An ill-framed objective or a quarterly review might
constitute a distraction.

But this sort of freedom can become airless and
feeble if not grounded in something real. And what could be more real,
more literally grounded, than the ever-shifting requirements of a
telecommunications giant during the most technologically explosive
century in human history?
