Today, like every other day, we wake up empty
and frightened.<br>
Donâ€™t open the door to the study and begin reading. <br>
Take down a musical instrument.<br><br>

Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>
There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

# RBL

I'm a quantum machine learning (QML) researcher in Maria Schuld's
group at [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/). Prior to that, I worked in
[high energy physics](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1868975). I'm
interested in the interplay between quantum algorithms, statistical learning theory, and
symmetry. I also run our
[QML journal club](https://heptar.ch/qml-jc).
