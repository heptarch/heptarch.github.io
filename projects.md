Bell Labs was a cool place. Over the course of a century, its researchers invented/discovered
lasers, the transistor, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, the Cosmic Microwave Background, electron diffraction, photovoltaic cells,
MOSFET, CCDs, optical fibres, `UNIX`, `C`, support
vector machines, the Fast Fourier Transform, Grover search,
and Shor's algorithm, and other innovations too numerous to name.
What made it special? Money, to begin with. Bell Labs operated
under the auspices of a state monopoly, so no one had to hustle for
grants, venture capital, or quarterly revenue.

But most steadily funded researchers don't win a Nobel Prize or a
Turing Award. By itself money doesn't make good research; it's something you worry about when there isn't
enough!
Of course, good industrial research is expensive, and more money
means more talent, more equipment, and more time. But outcomes are not
linear in these, and from a quick survey of well-heeled
Ivies or the moonshot factories of Big Tech,
its clear that money does not buy Bell-level success.
I think the special sauce was not material—the cash flow or the
personnel or the supply of oscilloscopes—but philosophical.

This little essay represents some tentative thoughts on why Bell Labs
was so successful as an "institute of creative technology", why
that success has been so hard to replicate, and how one might go
about replicating fragments of that success in a distributed,
self-organized, and anarchic fashion. If one were so inclined.

### 2.1. <a href="#tbc">The Kelly gang</a><a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

I stole that last line from Mervin Kelly, director of research from 1936
to 1943, and later president. A physicist by trade, Kelly played a
pivotal (though not quite Nobel-worthy) role in the invention of the transistor, and as
president, helped develop the laser and the solar cell.
He was the scientist-manager par excellence; to paraphrase Falstaff,
he was not only the cause of research in himself, but the cause that
research is in others.
At the same time, his views on scientific management would terrify a
modern CEO. Fundamental research was a "non-scheduled
area of work",<label for="sn-1"

   Telephone Laboratories-An Example of an Institute of Creative
   Technology"</a> (1950), Mervin Kelly.
	   </span> so the scientists did not have to jump through the
corporate hoops of OKRs, deadlines, or progress reports.
No hustle, no crunch; just research.

The buildings were designed to facilitate cross-talk, stimulation, and
focus. Kelly oversaw that alchemy as well. As he 
put it: "We give much attention to the maintenance of an atmosphere of
freedom and an environment stimulating to scholarship and scientific
research interest. It is most important to limit their work to that of
research." An ill-framed objective or a quarterly review might
distract from their real job.

Of course, to meet the technical needs of a giant like Bel, someone
had to keep track of what was going on, and do something with the
research. Once a fundamental research project reached maturity, it would be handed over to a development team. In
Kelly's words: "This pattern repeats itself again and again. A
research programme is initiated. Then as new knowledge that gives
promise of worthwhile application is obtained, a fundamental
development team is activated. It builds a background of basic
technology under the watchful eye and with the consultative aid of the
men of research." Researchers consulted, but were strictly forbidden
from helping to develop their research, lest they "lose contact with the
forefront of their field of scientific interest".

Development was only one of a number of concentric layers of
deployment, including systems engineering, facilities development, and
operations.
It's clear that Bell put a tremendous amount of effort into
structural policy and effective divisions of labour.
But these divisions really only imposed boundary conditions;
what happened within a division would be governed by differential equations set by
management.
Kelly could have treated his researchers as boffins in need of
practical guidance, or drones requiring coercive instruction.
It happens.
Instead, as the transistor episode shows, he saw them as 
collaborators, and directed their efforts with superb managerial and technical
nous. He lead from the inside.

One might be inclined to view this "institute of creative technology"
as a lucky and unrepeatable confluence of factors.
But Kelly directed Bell Labs for less than 10 years; there were many Kellys. The only way to
sustain success at that level for a century, I would argue, is to
marry material stability and good structure with a philosophy of
creative applied research that works.
Kelly gives us hints about this philosophy, but to help fill out the
negative space, we can look at institutions which do
*not* give rise to exceptional applied research.

### 2.2 <a href="#tbc">Between the tower and the boardroom</a><a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

The Institute for Advanced Study has more material
security, more on-paper freedom, more soaring ivory tower, than one could poke a
tenured chair at.
But its eminent faculty and promising young postdocs are respectively there by
postselection (what they did before they arrived) and preselection
(what they will likely do after they leave); not much happens because of the
Institute itself. As Feynman memorably put it: "Nothing happens
because there's not enough real activity and challenge: you're not in contact with the
experimental guys. You don't have to think how to answer questions
from the students. Nothing!"<label for="sn-1"

The IAS is too far removed to have an impact on reality.

At Bell Labs, Kelly made sure the theorists were in contact with the
experimentalists by literally building their offices next to each
other.
People would talk, share problems, and create interest groups across
disciplinary lines. Claude Elwood Shannon might ride his unicycle down
the hallway to talk to Tukey, Bardeen or Richard Hamming; the
metallurgists taught the chemists a cool trick that raised a weird
question about polymer synthesis, and later that day, a chemist
nerdsniped a materials physicist. Magic would happen.
But it wasn't just a critical mass of talent and cross-fertilizing
expertise: the research was ultimately grounded in the ever-shifting
operational requirements of the world's largest telecommunications
enterprise.

This did not literally mean solving Bell's operational conundra;
rather, through good management and institutional structure,
researchers would use their freedom to obey Paul Graham's dictum: “live in the future, then build what's
missing".
Or, as Kelly put it, the idea was to provide "the coupling between the
ever-advancing forefront of pure science and the forward march of our
communications technology. The closer the coupling, the more
completely will we keep in step with the progress of science."
This is worlds away from the enfeebled freedom at the IAS that Feynman
lampooned; the freedom to think, but about what?
But if you're put on a team with a telephony-relevant domain of
inquiry, told to get darn good at it, talk to your colleagues, think
big, ask stupid questions, and go test things out in the lab down the
hall, you end up with an institute of creative technology and not of
advanced study.

By the metric of domain complexity, Big Tech should be the new Bell Labs. Epitomized by
MAMAA (Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet), Big Tech does
indeed have patents, papers and products aplenty, with a track
record we can read off Nasdaq.
But despite the billions of dollars they pour into applied computer
science, the companies share only seven Turing Awards between them.<label for="sn-1"

Arguably, this a problem of timescale. Like the Nobel,
Turing Awards tend to arrive long after the fact; in twenty
years, I bet we will see more MAMAA employees on the honour
rolls.

But I wouldn't bet on too many more. The simple reason is that
Turing awards are not a good investment, and Big Tech's true
forte is making money. For better or worse, it knows the ROI is
in strategic deployment, marketing, and product integration, not fundamental algorithms research. This capitalist realpolitik explains
why Alphabet's has made massive cuts to its "moonshot factory" `X`,
and why research groups across MAMAA and beyond have aggressively
pivoted into generative AI.
Transformers are interesting, but a solved problem from a fundamental
science perspective; the rest is engineering.

### 2.3 <a href="#tbc">The recipe</a><a id="sec-2-3" name="sec-2-3"></a>

With a state-backed monopoly, this realpolitik just didn't apply to Bell.
The product ensured a healthy supply of capital and research problems,
but didn't govern the outcome.
In Big Tech, the product *is* the outcome.
And when it isn't connected to the product, we get the quirky
moonshots that sound like they were stolen from Randall Munroe's
latest book. Weather balloons that deliver internet to remote
locations are cool, but don't feel inevitable and important in the way
the laser does; they don't need to exist.
This is, I suspect, the Big Tech analogue of the IAS, where (again in
Feynman's words) "These poor bastards could now sit and think clearly
all by themselves, OK?"

Bell Labs did not pour excess capital into whimsical
moonshots. Everything they did was motivated; it was important; it was
focused. But because the research was decoupled from the profitability of
the system it served, they could afford to fail. They could afford to
let researchers be themselves, rather than corporate peons, and good
management directed the idiosyncratic energies---the physicists and
engineers, the foxes and hedgehogs, the goofballs, geniuses and
jerks---into collectively useful channels.
We might cautiously conclude that the recipe for success is equal
parts good science, good management, and good institutional practice,
with considerable overlap between ingredients.

I suspect there is both more and less to the success of Bell Labs than
the alchemy of this ill-specified mixture. More because, as we learn
from Kelly's lecture, Bell Labs had a rigid and highly systematic
division of labour, of which fundamental research was only one
part. This
