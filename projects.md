Today, like every other day, we wake up empty
and frightened.<br>
Donâ€™t open the door to the study and begin reading. <br>
Take down a musical instrument.<br><br>

Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>
There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

### <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rebel Labs</span>

Bell Labs was a cool place. Over the course of a century, its researchers invented/discovered
lasers, the transistor, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, the Cosmic Microwave Background, electron diffraction, photovoltaic cells,
MOSFET, charge-coupled devies, optical fibres, UNIX, C, Grover search,
Shor's algorithm, and other innovations too numerous to name.

What made it special? Money, to begin with. Bell Labs operated
under the auspices of a state monopoly, so no one had to hustle for
grants, venture capital, or quarterly revenue. But lots of researchers
have security of funding and don't win a Nobel Prize or a Turing
Award; money is something you worry about when there isn't
enough.
