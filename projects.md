### 2.1. <a href="#tbc">The Kelly gang</a><a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

Bell Labs was a cool place. Over the course of a century, its researchers invented/discovered
lasers, the transistor, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, the Cosmic Microwave Background, electron diffraction, photovoltaic cells,
MOSFET, charge-coupled devices, optical fibres, `UNIX`, `C`, support
vector machines, the Fast Fourier Transform, Grover search,
and Shor's algorithm, and other innovations too numerous to name.
What made it special? Money, to begin with. Bell Labs operated
under the auspices of a state monopoly, so no one had to hustle for
grants, venture capital, or quarterly revenue.

But most researchers with secure funding don't win a Nobel Prize or a Turing Award. Money is only something you worry about when there isn't
enough!
Of course, good industrial research is expensive, and more money
means more talent, more equipment, and more time. But outcomes are not
linear in these, and from a quick survey of well-heeled
Ivies or the moonshot factories of Big Tech,
its clear that money does not buy Bell-level success.
I think the special sauce was not material—the cash flow or the
personnel or the supply of oscilloscopes—but philosophical.

To illustrate, consider Mervin Kelly, director of research at Bell Labs from 1936
to 1943, and later president. A physicist by trade, Kelly played a
pivotal (though not quite Nobel-worthy) role in the invention of the transistor, and as
president, helped develop the laser and the solar cell.
He was the scientist-manager par excellence; to paraphrase Falstaff,
he was not only the cause of research in himself, but the cause that
research is in others.
At the same time, his views on scientific management would terrify a
modern CEO. Research was a "non-scheduled
area of work", so the scientists did not have to jump through the
corporate hoops of OKRs, deadlines, or progress reports.
No hustle, no crunch; just research.

The buildings were designed to facilitate disciplinary cross-talk, intellectual
stimulation, and focus. Kelly oversaw that alchemy as well. As he
put it: "We give much attention to the maintenance of an atmosphere of
freedom and an environment stimulating to scholarship and scientific
research interest. It is most important to limit their work to that of
research." An ill-framed objective or a quarterly review might
distract from their real job. But Kelly's management was not
invisible; as the transistor shows, he saw his researchers as
collaborators rather than underlings, and directed their efforts with
superb managerial and technical insight *from the inside*.

### 2.2 <a href="#tbc">Grounded freedom</a><a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

Kelly directed Bell Labs for less than $10$ years. There were many Kellys. The only way to
sustain that sort of success for a century, I would argue, is to marry material
security with a philosophy that works.
Kelly gives us some clues about this philosophy, but to fill out the
picture, let's look at some alternative institutional arrangements.
A place like the Institute for Advanced Study has more material
security, more on-paper ivory tower-freedom, than one could poke a
tenured chair at.
But its successes are postselected; not much happens one people arrive
at the Institute itself. As Feynman memorably put it: "Nothing happens because there's
not enough real activity and challenge: you're not in contact with the
experimental guys. You don't have to think how to answer questions
from the students. Nothing!"

At Bell Labs, Kelly made sure the theorists were in contact with the
experimentalists by literally building their offices next to each
other.
People would talk, share problems, and create interest groups across
disciplinary lines. Claude Elwood Shannon would ride his unicycle down
the hallway to talk to Tukey, Bardeen or Richard Hamming. Magic would
happen.
But it wasn't just a critical mass of talent and cross-fertilizing expertise.
Research was ultimately grounded in the physical reality and ever-shifting
operational requirements of the world's largest telecommunications
enterprise.

It was the job of directors like Kelly to understand those operational
gaps or possibilities for improvement, and pipe them into the lab.
If done properly, it meant there was never any shortage of hard and
important problems to work on.
This is very different from the enfeebled freedom that Feynman
criticized; the freedom to think, but about what? In mid-air, you have no
purchase or sense of direction. Set your feet on the earth, however,
and the freedom to move can guide you towards the glittering landmarks
in the distance.

By the logic of domain complexity and problem supply, Big Tech should be the new Bell Labs. Epitomized by
MAMAA (Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet), Big Tech does
indeed have patents, papers and products aplenty, and a track
record we can read off of Nasdaq.
But despite the billions of dollars they pour into applied computer
science, the companies share only seven Turing Awards between them.<label for="sn-1"

	   highly cited work at Bell Labs!
	   </span>
Arguably, this a problem of timescale. Like the Nobel,
Turing Awards tend to arrive long after the fact; in twenty
years, I bet we will see more MAMAA employees on the honour
rolls.

But I wouldn't bet on too many more. The simple reason is that
Turing awards are not a good investment, and these companies truly
shine at making money. For better or worse, Big Tech knows there is
more ROI in strategic deployment, marketing, and product integration
than fundamental algorithms research. This capitalist realpolitik explains
the massive cuts to Alphabet's "moonshot factory" `X`, or the one-track
focus on generative AI in research groups throughout MAMAA and
beyond. It

With a state-backed monopoly, this realpolitik just didn't apply to Bell.
