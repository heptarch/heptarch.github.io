**December 5, 2023.** *Six impossible things 1: guarding art
  galleries; counting factors; randomness and the axiom of choice;
  techno-moral panic in Greek geometry; why the sky is blue at day and
  at night.*

<h1>Six Impossible Things 1</h1>

"There's no use trying," she said. "One can't believe impossible
things."<br> <br>

"I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."<br>

Inspired by [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
hoping to blog in a semi-regular fashion on a few different topics
(nominally six) in science and technology. This week, 

<h2>I. Art galleries walls</h2>

<h2>II. Counting factors with Erdős–Kac</h2>

<h2>III. Beating randomness with the axiom of choice</h2>

<h2>IV. AI is the new neusis</h2>

<h2>V. Why the daytime sky is blue</h2>

<h2>VI. Why the nighttime sky is blue</h2>
