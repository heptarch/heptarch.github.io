**December 1, 2022.** *A whimsical post on naming things named after an instance after an instance.*

Sometimes general phenomena are named after specific instances.
For instance, a [mondegreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen)
is a misallocation of word boundaries, with "Lady Mondegreen" a
misallocated version of "laid him on the green".
Another example is the
[Baader-Meinhof effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion),
where something is encountered, apparently for the first time, and
suddenly noticed everywhere. In this case, a man called Terry Mullen
wrote to a newspaper in 1994 to describe this experience after hearing
about the eponymous
[Marxist guerilla group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction).
As you might guess, this triggered a wave of similar and apparently
novel experiences.

For our purposes, the most important example is the
[eggcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn): a semantically
sensible mishearing of a word, in this case,
named after "eggcorn", a cute but infelicitous version of "acorn".
