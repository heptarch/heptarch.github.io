**December 1, 2022.** *A whimsical post on naming the phenomenon of
  things named after an instance after an instance.*

Sometimes general phenomena are named after specific instances.
For instance, a [mondegreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen)
is a misinterpreation of word boundaries, with "Lady Mondegreen" a
mishearing of "laid him on the green".
Another example is the
[Baader-Meinhof effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion),
where a something is encountered, apparently for the first time, and
is suddenly encountered everywhere; the name is taken from the
[Marxist guerilla group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction)
and a man called Terry Mullen who noticed this effect and wrote to the
newspaper about it.

and [eggcorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn) --- are named
