**December 1, 2022.** *A whimsical post on naming things named after an instance after an instance.*

Sometimes general phenomena are named after specific instances.
For instance, a [mondegreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen)
is a misallocation of word boundaries, with "Lady Mondegreen" a
misallocated version of "laid him on the green".
Another example is the
[Baader-Meinhof effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion),
where something is encountered, apparently for the first time, and
then is suddenly noticed everywhere. In this case, a man called Terry Mullen
wrote to a newspaper in 1994 to describe this experience after hearing
about the eponymous
[Marxist guerilla group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction).
As you might guess, this triggered a wave of similar and apparently
novel experiences.
For our purposes, the most important example is the
[eggcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn): a semantically
sensible mishearing of a word, named after the instance "eggcorn", a cute but infelicitous version of "acorn".

We can lump these under the general heading of *instance-naming* (a
more specific term than metonym or synecdoche, where an instance can
be named after something more general). A few months ago, I set myself
the challenge of naming this phenomenon after an instance, and became
promptly stuck. How could I name it after an instance without getting
confused with the original referent? And if I came up with a new term,
how I could refer to an instance? It seemed impossible. I forgot about this
self-referential puzzle until a plane flight last week, where lack of
other amusements forced me to solve it.

The idea is simple: *modify* an instance so that it refers both to the
phenomenon of instance-naming, and to a specific instance of
instance-naming. The victim of mutation here is "eggcorn", which is
modified to "egcoin", which literally means "a new word based on an
example". For maximal silliness, here is a semantic equation:

$$
\text{egcoin} = \text{e.g. (example)} + \text{coin (create a new word)}.
$$

This has a clear link to "eggcorn". But it gets even better: on hearing
"egcoin", someone might mistakenly suppose they had heard "eggcorn",
making "egcoin" an "eggcorn" only if it is misheard as the latter.
