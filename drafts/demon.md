<div style="text-align: right">James Clerk Maxwell, <i>Paradoxical Ode</i>
</div> <br>

*1876.* All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Ellen Watson, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glows and hums in the dark: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Ellen gently pulls on a wire near her head, and the tug travels obediently
into the blackness. A pulley lurches, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leans forward, as if bowing.
The ball grows larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appears,
dancing around it, Ellen thinks, like angels on the head of a pin.
Or perhaps not: the teardrops lengthen inward into spikes, impaling the
ball through its corners, and Ellen gasps.
The spikes emerge from the opposite side, and the whole figure
convulses into new, more elaborate patchworks, like a
dancing star.

A demon shape, she concludes, grinning, and switches it off.

changing shape of the waves. "Ciamar?"<label for="sn-4"

know.
An old man arrives from Marischal Street, ruddy and out of
breath. "Child," he cries, then cracks into a smile: "What have you found now?"

*1874.* The Post Office pays the London
Pneumatic Despatch Company the extravagant sum of
£200,000 to build an underground distribution system for London’s
mail.
It is to consist of tubes laid with narrow-gauge rail, the air sucked out
by spinning iron turbines, 20-foot wide and driven by the Hephaestian
pistons of a Cornish engine.
Mail capsules are loaded and shot through the near-empty tubes,
propelled only by the inrushing atmosphere.
Construction commences in 1863 with a successful trial between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile hence.
The tubes makes it past Holborn, and as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
its ultimate terminus: unfavourable market conditions. Although the Post
Office uses it for a few years, it runs at a loss, and the system is officially retired in 1874.

But a company ambitious enough to propose a subterranean network of
pneumatic tubes
in the 1860s cannot reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus unconnected to the wheels of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders are only given small parts of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections are at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go.
A young woman is rumored to wander about
and attend to the machines.
The network is abandoned, but something bigger is already finished.

*1861.* The study overlooks the gentle slopes of Kilspindie glen. The
 reverend leans on a chestnut bureau: a hymnary, some notes in Gaelic,
 a lump of amygdule sparkling with calcite. His eyes are kind.
 "Child, what should you like to do? The schoolmaster tells me he can
 teach you nothing."

*1872.* Passengers waft like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall.
A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine---a mother of three
chases little William, who shrieks with delight---in the
shadows of the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in
shabby clothes curls up and sleeps.
All this commotion, the comings and goings, arrivals and leavetakings,
chaos and love and heartbreak and tobacco smoke, blur into a kind of
stillness, modulated only by the rhythm of the timetable.
Humans on average.

Ellen as usual does not enter the Great Hall.
Instead, she has resolved some disagreement with Foster
about the electromagnetic shadow of a sphere, and walks briskly from the student
laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street.
She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the
moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance.
The elevator, once summoned, clanks croakingly up like an oversized
frog, and gulps her into its wrought-iron mouth.
As it begins the slow descent to the
tunnels, the hum of coils and windings gets louder;
Ellen feels as if she is becoming her true self once more: a self
which expands through the old network, which winds in arcs of jagged light
through the despatch tubes, reflectors, and magnetized colloids.

The frog disgorges her at a junction of six tunnels, a few meters
across and choked with machinery. Ellen puts the lamp on a cluttered
desk and begins checking the instruments, adjusting,
configuring, jotting down readings, pulling on wires which
radiate from the junction into the dark of other machine banks.
She is about to start the cleaning cycle, but intuition---that
melodious voice which, not hers, has yet always accompanied
her---suggests to check the readings again.
There is a small discrepancy from the Holborn interferometer.
She does a quick calculation---guided by the voice---and concludes that one of the rotating
polarizations is *reversed*.
She knows the arrangement of reflectors better than the
veins in her hand. A stray reflection is impossible.
The simplest explanation is a Möbian loop which turns
the light inside out, like a glove; a loop that lies somewhere
*beyond* the Looking Glass.

Ellen gathers her lamp, compass, and notepad, and tramps off into
the tunnels to learn the precise bearings of the fourth dimension.

*1865.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
One of these men shares some scientific gossip: a lass, no more
 than ten, a ward of Auld Dauvit and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach",<label for="sn-1"

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The Duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting lowland cold.
 
"Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces the young "Miss Dewar" as an
 "exceedingly keen pupil of the modern developments". He folds himself into a
 chair in the front row and tenderly motions her to begin.
 Miss Dewar coughs nervously, and after receiving another paternal nod,
 addresses the small audience in a high, calm, clear voice:
 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px

 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Unified Dynamical Theory of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 sought to explain the mutual influence of
charged or magnetised bodies at a distance by the
hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. I will essay to develop a similar
theory for Newton's theory of gravity, which not only provides a medium by
which massive objects may act reciprocally upon one another when separated,
but by the supposition of an additional spatial dimension (Möbius,
Riemann, Hamilton &c), furnishes a
mechanism to combine gravity and electromagnetism.
In addition, this predicts small phenomenological departures from the
results of Maxwell and Faraday, which we might detect by suitably careful experiments...
</font>
</div>
The talk is gibberish to the Duke. The play of symbols, the
twined threads of argument, its flashes of scientific
wit, are lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Dewar's eyes, a flame which kindles something in
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
It is both childlike and strangely unchildlike, with something of the Old Testament
prophet.
Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her small frame can barely
contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos---disappointed in politics, business, himself, the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Ellen accepts.

*1869.* In the Beethoven Rooms of 76 Harley
Street, Carey Foster anxiously regards the bluestockings who have
assembled to learn about thermodynamics.
Ludwig van glowers at him from the wall.
"Heat"---he pauses, steadies himself, and tries to speak over the
disapproval of the portrait---"is not merely those sensible properties
of a teapot or a fireplace with which we are all familiar, and
therefore strike us as too commonplace to discuss. Heat
lives in the realm of measurable phenomena; its very sensibility gives
evidence of its effects. If measurable, it must admit of precise
determination. In these lectures, we will learn the means by which these
determinations are made, and the physical basis on which they rest."
He stops to ensure he has been understood. "Let us start by defining temperature..."

After the lecture and questions are finished, Foster is packing
his valise when a young girl approaches. Is she lost? She does not
look lost. "Professor Foster, I wonder if I might have a moment of
your time?" Bright and fearless. "Of course child. How
might I assist?"
"I have been carrying out researches into the optical properties of
magnetised fluids." He must restrain himself from laughing at the absurdity. "In what connection? And
how, ah, forgive me, how could you possibly get access to the necessary
equipment?"

She explains as if it was as commonplace as the teapot. "I am employed
by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to do so---much more
besides---considerable resources at my disposal, and so on. But to the point: are you familiar with Maxwell's paper on
the theory of governors, the mechanical contrivances by which a uniform
velocity of rotation is maintained? I have some notions
on how, by a combination of magnetism and cooling, we might apply
some of these effects to corpuscular machines. But I lack the requisite
expertise in chemistry. I remember you stating in your lectures on
acoustics that you had studied with Kekule."

The absurdity has somewhat changed character. Foster stammers:
"Corpuscular machines?" The sounds of evening traffic float in from
Marleybone. "Ah, you mean molecules. Perhaps... perhaps you would like
some tea?" The composer looks on with amusement.

 Chairman's desk. Inside:

*1875.* Over the course of several months, Ellen calibrates the weights,
 charges, and magnetic fields applied to the birefringent colloids of the Holborn
 detector, to image what she affectionately terms the "blob".
 She eventually concludes that the blob is vast---at
 least several thousand yards in diameter, probably much more---and floats
 a few yards "away" from Chancery House in a direction that no
 lawyer, however advanced his legal sophistry, could point to.

*1873.* The RMS *Atlantic*, a steam liner bound from Liverpool to New
 York City, diverts to Halifax in heavy weather and strikes a rock off
 Marr's Head.
 One C. Watson is listed as missing.
