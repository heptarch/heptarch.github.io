All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, 200 yards directly
below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.
