<div style="text-align: right">James Clerk Maxwell, <i>Paradoxical Ode</i>
</div> <br>

*1876.* All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Ellen Watson, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glows and hums in the dark: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Ellen gently pulls on a wire near her head, and the tug travels obediently
into the blackness. A pulley lurches, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leans forward, as if bowing.
The ball grows larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appears,
dancing around it, Ellen thinks, like angels on the head of a pin.
Or perhaps demons: the teardrops lengthen inward into spikes, impaling the
ball through its corners, and Ellen gasps.
The spikes emerge from the opposite side, and the whole figure
convulses into new, more elaborate patchworks, like a
dancing star.

A devilish shape, she concludes, grinning, and switches it off.

*1859.* A little girl is seen to wander Aberdeen's Trinity Quay, fascinated by the
changing shape of the waves. "Where's the go o' that?" she asks
passersby. They do not know.

*1874.* Under government pressure, the Post Office pays the London
Pneumatic Despatch Company the extravagant sum of
£200,000 to build an underground distribution system for London’s
mail.
It is to consist of tubes laid with narrow-gauge rail, cleared of air
by 20-foot wide iron turbines driven by the steaming, lopsided
hammer of a Cornish engine.
Mail capsules will be loaded up and shot through the near-empty tubes,
propelled only by the inrushing atmosphere.
Construction commences in 1863 with a successful trial between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile hence.
The tubes makes it past Holborn, and as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
its ultimate terminus: unfavourable market conditions. Although the Post
Office uses it for a few years, the system is officially retired in 1874.

But a company ambitious enough to propose a subterranean network of
pneumatic tubes
in the 1860s cannot reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus unrelated to the centrifugal wheels of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders are only given small parts of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections are at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go.
A white-haired professor and a young woman are rumored to wander about
and attend to the machines.

The network is abandoned, but something bigger is already finished.

*1861.* The study overlooks the gentle slopes of Kilspindie glen. The
 reverend leans on a chestnut bureau: a hymnary, some notes in Gaelic,
 a lump of amygdule sparkling with calcites. His eyes are kind.
 "Child, what should you like to do? The schoolmaster tells me he can
 teaching you nothing."

"I... I feared as much. Susan is too ill to travel to Aberdeen, but we
want what is best for you. Do you remember Professor Thomson?"

*1875.* Passengers waft like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall.
A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine---a mother of three
chases little William, who shrieks with delight---in the
shadows of the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in
shabby clothes curls up and sleeps.
All this commotion, the comings and goings, arrivals and leavetakings,
chaos and love and heartbreak and tobacco smoke, blur into a kind of
stillness, modulated only by the rhythm of the timetable.
Humans on average.

Ellen as usual does not enter the Great Hall.
Instead, she has resolved some disagreement with Professor Foster
about magnetism and birefringence, and walks briskly from the student
laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street.
She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the
moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance.
The elevator, once summoned, clanks croakingly up like an oversized
frog, and gulps her into its wrought-iron mouth.
As it begins the slow journey down to the
tunnels, the hum of coils and windings gets louder;
Ellen feels as if she is becoming her true self once more: a self
which expands through the old network, which winds in arcs of jagged light
through the silvered despatch tubes and magnetized colloids.

The frog disgorges her at a junction of six tunnels, a few meters
across and choked with machinery. Ellen puts the lamp on a cluttered
desk and begins checking the instruments, adjusting,
configuring, jotting down readings, pulling on wires which
radiate from the junction into the dark of other machine banks.
She is about to start the Holborn cleaning cycle, but some premonitory
instinct stops her; she checks the readings again and notes a small
discrepancy. It could be dead rats in the tubes, blocking the light.

Or it could be an object in another dimension.

*1865.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
One of these men shares some scientific gossip: a lass, no more
 than ten, a ward of Auld Dauvit and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach",<label for="sn-1"

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The Duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting lowland cold.
 
"Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces the young "Miss Dewar" as an
 "exceedingly keen pupil of the modern developments". He folds himself into a
 chair in the front row and tenderly motions her to begin.
 Miss Dewar coughs nervously, and after receiving another paternal nod,
 addresses the small audience in a high, calm, clear voice:
 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px

 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Unified Dynamical Theory of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 sought to explain the mutual influence of
charged or magnetised bodies at a distance by the
hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. I will essay to develop a similar
theory for Newton's theory of gravity, which not only provides a medium by
which massive objects may act reciprocally upon one another when separated,
but by the supposition of an additional spatial dimension, furnishes a
mechanism to combine gravity and electromagnetism.
In addition, this predicts small phenomenological departures from the
results of Maxwell and Faraday, which we might detect by suitably careful experimental work...
</font>
</div>
The talk is gibberish to the Duke. The play of symbols, the
twined threads of argument, its flashes of scientific
wit, are lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Dewar's eyes, a flame which kindles something in
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
It is both childlike and strangely unchildlike, with something of the Old Testament
prophet.
Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her small frame can barely
contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos---disappointed in politics, business, himself, the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Ellen accepts.

Over the course of several months, Ellen calibrates the weights,
 charges, and magnetic fields applied to the birefringent colloids of the Holborn
 detector, to image what she affectionately terms the "blob".
 She eventually concludes that the blob is vast---at
 least several thousand yards in diameter, probably much more---and floats
 a few yards "away" from Chancery House in a direction that no
 lawyer, however advanced his legal sophistry, could point to.

She has pulsed the blob with light to see what it absorbs.
One evening, it begins to pulse back.
