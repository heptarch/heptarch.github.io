Since all the tools for my untying <br>
In four-dimensioned space are lying, <br>
Where playful fancy intersperses <br>
Whole avenues of universes...

All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details were
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, in turn 200
yards directly beneath the stationmaster's rum, gazed with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glowed and hummed in the darkness: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Susan gently pulled a wire near her head, and the tug travelled obediently
into the darkness. A pulley lurched, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leaned forward as if bowing.
The ball grew larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appeared around
it, dancing, Susan thought, like angels on the head of a pin, or the
apostles celebrating their master.
But then the teardrops lengthened inward into spikes, and cruelly pierced the
ball; Susan gasped, shocked by a twelvefold betrayal beyond anything in the scriptures.
The spikes pushed through to the other side of the ball, and the whole figure
shivered and convulsed, dancing into new, more convoluted patchworks, oblivious to the fate of the ball...

A devilish shape, she thought, and switched it off.
