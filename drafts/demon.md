<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Since all the tools for my untying <br>
In four-dimensioned space are lying, <br>
Where playful fancy intersperses <br>
Whole avenues of universes...

<div style="text-align: right">James Clerk Maxwell, <i>Paradoxical Ode</i>
</div>

All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details were
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, 200 yards directly
below the stationmaster's rum, gazed with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.
