*1875.* All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Ellen Watson, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A shape glows and hums in the dark, symmetric as
a jewel and bristling with spikes.
Ellen pulls on a wire near her head. A pulley lurches, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and ribbons of
piping leans forward.
The shape responds, folding itself into new patterns. Spikes
withdraw, merge, and suddenly detach to form a constellation of twelve
teardrops guarding a central globe.
The teardrops shrink into themselves and disappear.

So this, Ellen thinks, is how you
summon a demon.

*1859.* A little girl is seen to wander Aberdeen's Trinity Quay, fascinated by the
changing shape of the waves as they bounce off the dock wall. "Ciamar?"<label for="sn-4"

<span class="sidenote">How?</span> she asks passersby. They do not
know.
An old man arrives from Marischal Street, ruddy and out of
breath. "Child," he cries, then cracks into a smile: "What have you found now?"

*1874.* The Post Office pays the London
Pneumatic Despatch Company the extravagant sum of
£200,000 to build an underground distribution system: mile-long tubes, laid with narrow-gauge rail, emptied by
20-foot wide iron turbines, and shooting post capsules like bullets
with inrushing air.
Construction commences in 1863 with a successful test run between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile hence.
The tubes make it past Holborn, and as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
their ultimate terminus: a bear market. Although the Post
Office uses it for a couple of years, it runs at a loss, and the system is officially retired in 1874.

A company ambitious enough to propose a subterranean network of
pneumatic tubes cannot reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus unconnected to the wheels of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders are only given small parts of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections are at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go.
A young woman is rumored to wander about
and attend to the machines.
The network is abandoned, but a larger enterprise continues.

*1861.* The study overlooks the gentle slopes of Kilspindie glen. The
 reverend leans on his chestnut bureau: a hymnary, some notes in Gaelic,
 a lump of amygdule sparkling with calcite. His eyes are kind.
 "Child, what should you like to do? The schoolmaster tells me he can
 teach you nothing."

*1873.* Passengers waft like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall.
A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine---a mother of three
chases little William, who shrieks with delight---in the
shadows of the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in
shabby clothes curls up and sleeps.
All this commotion, the comings and goings, arrivals and leavetakings,
chaos and heartbreak and tobacco smoke, blur into a kind of
stillness, modulated only by the rhythm of the timetable.
Humans on average.

Ellen as usual does not enter the Great Hall.
Instead, she has resolved a disagreement with Foster
about the electromagnetic shadow of a sphere, and walks briskly from the student
laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street.
She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the
moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance.
The elevator, once summoned, clanks croakingly up like an oversized
frog and gulps her into its wrought-iron mouth.
As it begins the slow descent to the
tunnels, the hum of coils and windings gets louder, and
Ellen feels as if she is becoming her true self once more: a self
which expands through the old network, which winds in arcs of jagged light
through the despatch tubes, reflectors, and magnetized colloids.

The frog disgorges her at a junction of six tunnels, a few meters
across and choked with machinery. Ellen puts the lamp on a cluttered
desk and begins checking the instruments, adjusting,
configuring, jotting down readings, pulling on wires which
radiate from the junction into the dark of other machine banks.
She is about to start the cleaning cycle, but intuition---that
melodious voice which, not hers, has yet always accompanied
her---suggests to check the readings again.
There is a small discrepancy from the Holborn interferometer.
She does a quick calculation---guided by the voice---and finds the
results are consistent with *reversing* one of the polarizations.

She knows the arrangement of reflectors better than the
veins in her hand. A stray reflection is impossible.
She pauses for a moment.
Parsimony suggests that it is not a stray reflection, but a mirror in
a plane she cannot see.
Ellen gathers her lamp, compass, and notepad, and tramps off into
the tunnels to learn the precise bearings of the fourth dimension.

*1865.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
They share scientific gossip: a lass, no more
 than ten, a ward of Auld Dauvit and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach",<label for="sn-1"

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The Duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting lowland cold.
 
Auld "Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces the young "Miss Watson" as an
 "exceedingly keen pupil of the modern developments". He folds himself into a
 chair in the front row and tenderly motions her to begin.
 Miss Watson coughs nervously, and after receiving another paternal nod,
 addresses the room in a high, calm, clear voice:
 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px
solid black; line-height:1.3;">
 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Unified Dynamical Theory of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 sought to explain the mutual influence of
charged or magnetised bodies at a distance by the
hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. I will essay to develop a similar
theory for Newton's theory of gravity, which not only provides a medium by
which massive objects may act reciprocally upon one another when separated,
but by the supposition of an additional spatial dimension (see Möbius,
Riemann, Hamilton &c), furnishes a
mechanism to combine gravity and electromagnetism.
In addition, this predicts small phenomenological departures from the
results of Maxwell and Faraday, which we might detect by suitably careful experiments...
</font>
</div>
The talk is gibberish to the Duke. The play of symbols, the
twined threads of argument, its flashes of scientific
wit, are lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Watson's eyes, a flame which kindles
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
It is both childlike and strangely unchildlike; it has something of
the Old Testament prophet or the Greek philosopher in it.
Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her small
frame can barely contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos---disappointed in politics, business, himself, the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Ellen accepts.

*1869.* In the Beethoven Rooms of 76 Harley
Street, Professor Carey Foster anxiously regards the bluestockings who have
assembled to learn about thermodynamics.
Ludwig van glowers at him from the wall.
"Heat"---he pauses, steadies himself, and tries to speak over the
disapproval of the portrait---"heat, ladies, is not merely those sensible properties
of a teapot or a fireplace with which we are all familiar, and
therefore strike us as too commonplace to explain. Heat
lives in the realm of measurable phenomena; its very sensibility gives
evidence of its effects. If measurable, it must admit of precise
determination. In these lectures, we will learn the means by which these
determinations are made, and the physical basis on which they rest. We
will cover thermometry, calorimetry, and the basic dynamical
principles governing the evolution of a thermodynamic system---like our
friend the teapot."
He stops to ensure he has been understood. "Let us start with the
definition of temperature..."

After the lecture and questions are finished, Foster is packing
his valise when a young girl approaches. Is she lost? She does not
look lost. "Professor Foster, I wonder if I might have a moment of
your time?" Bright and fearless; intriguing. "Of course child. How
might I assist?" She proffers a notebook.
"I have been carrying out researches into the optical properties of
magnetised fluids." He restrains himself from laughing at the absurdity. "In what connection? And
how, forgive me, could you possibly get access to the necessary
equipment?" He leafs theatrically through the notebook. Mere scribbles.

She explains as if it was as commonplace as the teapot. "I am employed
by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to do so---much more
besides---considerable resources at my disposal, and so on. But to the point: are you familiar with Maxwell's paper on
the theory of governors, the mechanical contrivance by which a uniform
velocity of rotation is maintained, in a turbine for example? By a combination of magnetism and
cooling, I think we might apply these notions to corpuscular machines, but I fear
some of the finer points of experimental chemistry elude me. I remember you stating in your lectures on
acoustics that you studied with Kekulé?" The notebook becomes
suddenly clear, swimming before him in equations, engineering schematics, scattered exclamations of EYPHKA!
The absurdity has somewhat changed character.

Beethoven looks on with amusement. Foster stammers:
"Corpuscular machines? Ah, you mean molecules. Perhaps..." Evening traffic floats in from
Marleybone. "Perhaps you would like
some tea?"

*1873.* An envelope, ironically delivered by coach, arrives on the
 chairman's desk; a welcome distraction from negotiations with the
 GPO. Inside:

</div>

Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville
chuckles, thinking of that frigid morning in Aberdeen and all its corollaries.
He skips past patents and maintainance summaries to the yearly
planning, which includes the item:

 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px

 <font size="-0.2">

</font>
</div>

Not, the Duke supposes, a large dead rat in the Holborn despatch tube again.
It must be---as Ellen had hoped---an artefact, hovering near
Chancery Lane in a direction that no lawyer, however advanced his
legal sophistry, could point to.

*1874.* In a dream, Ellen returns to Trinity Quay. It is like
 childhood, but bathed in a gentle greyness, as if the light cannot quite touch
 the objects it falls upon.
 A small rowboat is moored where the Kirkland ferry usually
 departs.
 Ellen is drawn ineluctably towards it, and immediately, without effort, it begins to move, gaining
 speed from Victoria dock into the turning basin, and then outwards,
 outwards to the North Sea.
 Now they are hurtling, the oars
 flat in the rowlocks and skimming the water, she and the boat one breathless motion.
Facing backwards, the frozen
light of Aberdeen grows smaller; beneath, the mild swell of the wave
which bears them towards an island ringed by darkness.

The dream lurches.
Ellen is moored on the other side of a craggy, rough-hewn
breakwater which reaches into the sky.
On the island, a small rise is surmounted by the outlines of a Chancery
Lane shopfront: Ede & Ravenscroft, tailors by appointment of Her Majesty.
The store blooms into color, and Ellen's view is
pulled beneath its trefoiled architrave, past the juridical wigs and
robes and orders of chivalry,
up the stairs to a humble bedroom lit only by the embers of a fire.

The little Rumpelstiltskin man sits in a green armchair, all tatters,
devouring a scone. His eyes bulge, and beads of sweat glisten
dully on his forehead. He continues: "So, well, I had a few billion
years to lick my wounds and dream up plans for escape. Ha! In this great grand
stellar begoo. But the Veem---those meddling bureaucrats---are as
thorough as they are boring. Ha! You understand?" They have been
talking for hours.
There is a plate of crumbs beside them; Rumpelstiltskin clicks his
fingers and the crumbs assemble into a scone.
"I am much reduced. The confining potential keeps the
surface area small---Bekenstein you know---and stops me from
replenishing, but I still have a few tricks. Begoo!"
The logs in the fire crackle and unburn brightly. "I may have borrowed a
dollop of negentropy," he says with a sheepish grin.

Another lurch. Ellen wakes with three white hairs.

*3980221461 BC.* Creatures the size of planetoids keen over the sky,
bristling with teeth and luminescent ruin.
The largest, swollen and multi-limbed, is pursued by a flock of smaller ones, like a
spider by flies.
The spider savages one fly, then another, in huge flickering whips
of light, ingesting them before they can heal.
But there are so many flies; some are attached, leech-like, to its
side, and from open wounds blobs of fluid and disembodied
structure radiate into the void.
It is bleeding to death.

Twelve flies break off from the swarm, forming an icosahedral web
thousands of miles wide around the dying spider.
It thrashes, lunges, tries to flee; the web quivers and the fly at each
vertex strafes fluidly out of reach.
Slowly, with ritual symmetry, they pull the web closed, folding up
space as they go.

From afar, it looks like a star dimming.

*1857.* A single candle burns low in the granite citadel of Marischal
 College. "Katherine, why in God's name would you conceal that?"

"Because you---or rather, I---cannot be saddled with that and expect a
chair at Edinburgh."

"But the child---" "---will be well-loved by my parents, I can assure
you. My father has arranged something in the parish register."

A pause. "And how am I to view her?" The only answer is the dwindling flame.
