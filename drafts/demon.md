The universe is huge, ancient, and marvelously strange. But the greatest miracle of all is that
it is knowable. Our knowledge may be fragmentary and often plain wrong; that is the basic
predicament of science. But it makes it no less miraculous that we can unravel the biological
blueprint of a daffodil, land a robot on the red sands of Mars, or hear the faint chirp of black
holes colliding, in the depths of space, a billion years ago. There is awe and beauty and cosmic
providence in this. This book is written from the conviction that awe, beauty, and providence
are almost entirely missing from our curricula. We teach the wrong things, using the wrong
methods, for the wrong reasons. The outcome is, of course, deeply
wrong.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin=-50px 0px;">
Let me elaborate. If students learn to reproduce known results by rote, they will take both
the methods and the results for granted. Of course gravity obeys an inverse square law! It’s
obvious. But why? What assumptions does this depend on? What else might obey an inverse
square law, and what happens if it doesn’t? They neither know nor care because they are
taught not to. In the same vein, when we assess mastery by trivial variations on known things,
students come to identify mastery with trivial variation. After variation number 173, they will
resent this “mastery” and see it for the sham that it is. No wonder so many people drop math
faster than a hot potato! But worst of all, students learn to mask their ignorance. There is no
better way to discourage a love of play and a taste for the unknown than by labelling questions
“stupid”, and rewarding those who “fake it till they make it”. Or, more realistically, simply go
on faking.
