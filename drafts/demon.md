*1875.* All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glows and hums in the dark: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Susan gently pulls on a wire near her head, and the tug travels obediently
into the blackness. A pulley lurches, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leans forward, as if bowing.
The ball grows larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appears around
it, dancing, Susan thought, like angels on the head of a pin.
But then the teardrops lengthen inward into spikes, impaling the
ball through its corners; Susan gasps.
The spikes push through to the opposite side, and the whole figure
convulses, shivering forth into new, more elaborate patchworks, like a
dancing star.

A devilish shape, she concludes, grinning, and switches it off.

*1860.* A little girl is seen to wander Aberdeen's Trinity Quay, fascinated by the
changing shape of the waves. "Where's the go o' that?" she asks
passersby. They do not know.

*1874.* Passengers shuffle like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall.
A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine---a mother of three
chases little William, who shrieks with delight---in the
shadows of the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in
shabby clothes curls up on the ground and cries.
All this commotion, the comings and goings, arrivals and leavetakings,
chaos and love and heartbreak, blur into a kind of
stillness, modulated only by the rhythym of the timetable.

Susan as usual does not enter the Great Hall.
Instead, she has resolved some disagreement with Professor Foster
about birefringence (in her favour) and walks briskly from the student
laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street.
She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the
moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance.
She summons the elevator, which clanks croakingly up like an oversized frog.
It swallows her up, and she begins the slow journey down into the
tunnels, the hum of coils and transformers getting louder.

The frog disgorges her

*1865.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
One of these men shares a novelty: a lass, no more
 than ten, a protege of Prof. Thomson and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach",<label for="sn-1"

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The Duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting lowland cold.
 
"Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces the young "Miss Dewar" as an
 "exceedingly keen pupil of the modern developments". He folds himself into a
 chair in the front row and motions her to begin.
 Miss Dewar coughs nervously, and after receiving another paternal nod,
 addresses the small audience in a high, calm, clear voice:

<b>A Dynamical Theory of Gravity United with Electromagnetism</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 sought to explain the mutual influence of
charged or magnetised bodies at a distance by the
hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. I will essay to develop a similar
theory for Newton's theory of gravity, which not only provides a medium by
which massive objects may act reciprocally upon one another when separated,
but by the supposition of an additional spatial dimension, provides a
natural means to unify gravity and and electromagnetic theory.
In addition, this predicts small phenomenological departures from the
results of Maxwell and Faraday, which we might detect by suitably careful experimental work...

</div>
The talk is largely gibberish to the Duke. The play of symbols, the
contrivance and subtlety of reasoning, the flashes of scientific
wit, are lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Dewar's eyes, a flame which kindles something in
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
It is strangely unchildlike.
Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her disquisition can barely
contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos---disappointed in politics, business, himself, the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Susan accepts.

*1874.* The London Pneumatic Despatch Company raises the extravagant sum of
¬£150,000 for an underground network of pneumatic tubes to
distribute London's mail.
Construction commences in 1863 with a short experimental stretch between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile distant.
The network makes it past Holborn, as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
its ultimate terminus: unfavourable market conditions. Although the Post
Office uses it in a desultory fashion for a few years, like a child
with a makeshift toy,
the network is officially
discontinued in 1874.

But a company ambitious enough to propose an underground pneumatic
network cannot reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus that seem unrelated to the centrifugal mechanism of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders are only given small parts of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections are at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go.
The network is abandoned but something bigger is already finished.
