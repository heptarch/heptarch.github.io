All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details were
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazed with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glowed and hummed in the dark: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Susan gently pulled on a wire near her head, and the tug travelled obediently
into the blackness. A pulley lurched, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leaned forward, as if bowing.
The ball grew larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appeared around
it, dancing, Susan thought, like angels on the head of a pin.
But then the teardrops lengthened inward into spikes, cruelly piercing the
ball through its corners, and Susan gasped.
The spikes pushed through to the opposite side, and the whole figure
convulsed, shivering into new, more elaborate patchworks, the ball
swallowed up by its dancing assailants.

A devilish shape, she concluded, grinning, and switched it off.

*1860*. A little girl is seen to wander Aberdeen's Trinity Quay, fascinating by the
changing shape of the waves. "What's the go o' that?" she asks
passersby. They do not know.

In the 1860s, the London Pneumatic Despatch Company raised the extravagant sum of
£150,000. Their stated goal: to build an underground network of pneumatic tubes for
distributing London's mail, commencing with a short experimental stretch between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile distant.
Construction started, and made it as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
its ultimate terminus. Although the Post
Office used it in a desultory fashion for a few years, like a child
with a disappointing toy for which it has no alternative,
the network was underperforming, overbudget, and was officially
discontinued in 1874.

But a company ambitious enough to propose an underground pneumatic
network could not reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings would be confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they were forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus that seemed unrelated to pneumatics of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders were confined to work only on small parts of the network.
Questions about other sections were at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who kept asking were let go.
Though the network was abandoned, something bigger was already finished.

*1865*. Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of more debts than titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
One of these men confesses that a phenomenon is afoot: a lass, no more
 than 10, a protege of Prof. Thomson and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach", is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself in Cromwell Tower the next morning, in the biting cold,
 laboriously ascending the granite steps to the lecture hall.
 The talk itself is largely gibberish:<br>
