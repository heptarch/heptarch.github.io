  <i>1875.</i> All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon—sky
  alternating between bruised peach and gravecloth—rain imminent—the
  coach horses, champing and steaming in their oiled leather beneath
  Euston Arch—and now the stationmaster, taking a quick swig and
  eyeing the coffered vault of the Great Hall with mindless
  curiosity—all these details are infinitely beneath the notice of
  Ellen Watson, who, 200 yards directly below the stationmaster’s rum,
  gazes with rapture at the fragile and impossible shape before
  her. Induction coils hum, and a hundred electromagnets, girding
  their halocarbon alembics and scattered across London, sing a great
  shadow into being.

So, Ellen thinks, this is how you summon a demon.

<i>1875.</i> The General Post Office pays the London
Pneumatic Despatch Company the extravagant sum of £200,000 to build an
underground distribution system: tunnels of narrow gauge rail, emptied
by 20-foot wide iron turbines and shooting capsules like bullets with
inrushing air. Construction commences in 1863 with a successful test
run between Euston Square and the North West District Post Office.
The tubes make it past Holborn, and as far as the General Post Office
on St Martin’s le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before
arriving at their ultimate terminus: a bear market. Although the Post
Office uses the tubes for a couple of years, they run at a loss, and
the system is officially retired.

But a company ambitious enough to propose a subterranean network of
pneumatic tubes cannot reasonably be expected to stop there. Visitors
to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary tunnels, forks
they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming pieces of apparatus
unconnected to the turbines or the cacophonous engines which drive
them. Engineers and builders are given only fragments of the
blueprint. Questions about other sections are at first politely, then
firmly, discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go. A young
woman is rumored to wander about and attend to the machines. Although
the network is abandoned, a larger enterprise continues.

<i>1865.</i> Richard Plantagenet Campbell
Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not
without his moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen
in his capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company
to consult some engineers. They share a corker: a lass, no more than
ten, a ward of Auld Dauvit and, one mutters darkly, a ``leanabh

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture on natural
philosophy. The Duke is intrigued—he has a daughter the same age—and
finds himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell
Tower the next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting
lowland cold.

Auld Dauvit Thomson, an immense, stentorian don
who must stoop to
enter the classroom, introduces "Miss Watson'' as an "exceedingly
sharp pupil of the modern developments''. He folds himself into a
chair in the front row and tenderly motions her to begin. Miss Watson
coughs nervously, and after another paternal nod, addresses the room
in a high, calm, clear voice:

 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px
solid black; line-height:1.3;">
 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Unified Dynamical Theory of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 explains the mutual influence of
    charged or magnetised bodies, without action at a distance, by the
    hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. Analogously, I posit a
    gravitational field for Newtonian gravity. By
    supposing a fourth spatial dimension
    (cf. Möbius, Riemann, Hamilton &c), this additionally furnishes a
    mechanism by which to unify gravity and electromagnetism...
</font>
</div>

The talk is gibberish to
    the Duke. The play of symbols, the twined threads of argument, its
    flashes of scientific wit, are lost on him; what is not lost,
    however, is the flame of living joy in Miss Watson’s eyes, a flame
    which kindles his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the
    room. It is both childlike and strangely unchildlike, with
    something of the Old Testament prophet or the Greek philosopher in
    it. Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her
    small frame can barely contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos—disappointed in politics,
business,
the whole backward scheme of his life—formulates the terms of an offer he will later describe as "inspired lunacy''. Ellen accepts.

Dewar leans on his chestnut bureau: a hymnary, some notes in Gaelic, a
lump of amygdule sparkling with calcite. His eyes are kind. “Child,

<i>1869.</i> In the Beethoven Rooms of 76 Harley Street, Professor Carey
Foster anxiously regards the bluestockings who have assembled to learn
thermodynamics. Ludwig van glowers at him from the wall. “Heat”—he
pauses, steadies himself, and tries to speak over the disapproval of
the portrait—“heat, ladies, is not merely those sensible properties of
a teapot or a fireplace with which we are all familiar, and therefore
strike us as too commonplace to merit discussion. Heat lives in the
realm of measurable phenomena; its very sensibility is evidence of its
effects. If measurable, it must admit of precise determination. In
these lectures, we will learn how these determinations are made, and
the physical basis on which they rest. We will cover thermometry,
calorimetry, and the basic dynamical principles governing the
evolution of a thermodynamic system—like our friend the teapot.” He
smiles and looks around the room. “Let us start with the definition of
temperature...”

After the lecture and questions are finished, Foster is packing his
valise when a young girl approaches, the daughter, perhaps, of one of
his listeners. Is she lost? She does not look lost. “Professor Foster,
I wonder if I might have a moment of your time?” Bright and fearless;
intriguing. “Of course child. How might I assist?” She proffers a
notebook. “I have been carrying out some investigations of the
optical properties of magnetised fluids.” He restrains himself from
laughing at the absurdity. “Forgive me, but that scarcely seems
likely. In what connection?” A bluestocking is having him on. He leafs
theatrically through the notebook. Scribbles.

She explains as if it was as unremarkable as the teapot. “I am
employed by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to do so—much more
besides—considerable resources at my disposal, and so on. But to the
point: are you familiar with Maxwell’s paper on the theory of
governors, the mechanical contrivance by which a uniform velocity of
rotation is maintained, in a turbine for example? I think we might
apply these notions to ‘corpuscular machines’, but the finer points of
experimental chemistry elude me. I remember you stating in your
lectures on acoustics that you studied with Kekulé?”

The notebook becomes suddenly clear, swimming before him in equations,
engineering schematics, reaction pathways, scattered exclamations of
EYPHKA! The absurdity has somewhat changed character.
Beethoven looks on with amusement. Foster stammers: “Corpuscular
machines? Ah, you mean molecules. Perhaps…” Evening traffic floats in
from Marleybone. “Perhaps you would like some tea?”

<i>1873.</i> Passengers waft like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall. A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine—a mother of three chases little William, who shrieks with delight—beneath the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in shabby clothes curls up and sleeps. All this commotion, the comings and goings, chaos and heartbreak and tobacco smoke, blur into a kind of stillness, modulated only by the rhythm of the timetable. Humans on average.

Ellen as usual does not enter the Great Hall. Instead, she has resolved a disagreement with Foster about the electromagnetic shadow of a sphere, and walks briskly from the student laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street. She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance. The elevator, once summoned, clanks croakingly up like an oversized frog and gulps her into its wrought-iron mouth. As it begins the slow descent to the tunnels, the hum of coils and windings gets louder, and Ellen feels as if she is becoming her true self once more: a self which expands through the old network, which winds in arcs of jagged light through the despatch tubes, reflectors, and magnetized colloids.

The frog disgorges her at a junction of six tunnels, a few meters
across and choked with machinery. Ellen puts the lamp on a cluttered
desk and begins checking the instruments, adjusting, configuring,
jotting down readings, pulling on wires which radiate from the
junction into the dark of other machine banks. She is about to start
the vacuum cycle, but intuition—that strangely melodious voice which, not hers,
has yet
always accompanied her—suggests she check the readings
again. There is a small discrepancy from the Holborn
interferometer. She does a quick calculation—guided by the voice—and
finds results consistent with reversing a polarization.

She knows the arrangement of reflectors better than the veins in her
hand; a stray reflection is impossible. She pauses for a
moment. Parsimony suggests that it is not a stray reflection, but a
mirror, albeit in some “otherspace” she cannot see. Ellen gathers her
lamp, compass, and notepad, and tramps off into the tunnels to learn
the precise bearings of the fourth dimension.

<i>1873.</i> An envelope, ironically delivered by coach, arrives on the chairman’s
desk; a welcome distraction from negotiations with the GPO. Inside:

Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville
chuckles, thinking of that frigid morning in Aberdeen and all its
corollaries. He skips past patents and maintenance summaries to the
yearly planning, which includes the item:

</font>
</div>

Not, the Duke supposes, a large dead rat in the Holborn
despatch tube again. It must be—as Ellen had hoped—an artefact,
hovering near Chancery Lane in a direction that no lawyer, however
advanced his legal sophistry, could point to.

<p align="center">
Ȣ
  </p>

In a dream, Ellen returns to Trinity Quay. It is like
childhood, but bathed in a gentle greyness, as if the light cannot
quite touch the objects it falls upon. A small rowboat is moored where
the Kirkland ferry usually departs. Ellen is drawn ineluctably towards
it, and immediately, without effort, it begins to move, gaining speed
from Victoria dock into the turning basin, and then outwards, outwards
to the North Sea. Now they are hurtling, the oars flat in the rowlocks
and skimming the water, she and the boat one breathless motion.

The dream lurches. Ellen is moored on the other side of a craggy,
rough-hewn breakwater which reaches into the sky and hides Aberdeen
behind it. The breakwater encloses an island, surmounted by the
shadowy outlines of a Chancery Lane shopfront: Ede \& Ravenscroft,
tailors by royal appointment. She moves closer, and the store blooms
into color, sweeping her view beneath its trefoiled architrave, past
the juridical wigs and robes and orders of chivalry, and up the stairs
to a humble bedroom lit only by the embers of a dying fire.

The little Rumpelstiltskin man sits in a green armchair, all tatters,
devouring a scone. His eyes bulge, and beads of sweat glisten dully on
his forehead. She senses they have been talking for hours. There is a
plate of crumbs beside them, and his flute of a voice sparkles : “Why, what a thoughtless begoo I am!
Guests should not go hungry at Ashen House. Ha!” The little man
clicks his fingers and the crumbs assemble into a scone. “I may have
borrowed a dollop of negentropy,” he says sheepishly.

Another lurch. Ellen wakes with three white hairs.

<p align="center">

  </p>

<i>1875.</i> Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville stands in his old LPDC office, empty but for a chestnut bureau and a box of yellowing reports. Through the window, he can see the twin giants of Westminster towering over Dean’s Yard. He has that air of abstraction and regret that so often hovers about men of station; he has just learned from Disraeli that he will govern Madras. Luck never seemed to him personified by a Lady, but rather a profligate and wastrel Lord, who giveth or taketh depending on his humour, and in whose service each of us is, from time to time, dragooned.

A knock at the door. “Ah, Miss Watson. Come in.” Ellen enters; the
Duke continues to gaze at Hawksmoor’s giants. “I remember your talk at
Aberdeen ten years ago. I understood nothing, except that, like Atlas,
with a little leverage you could move the world.” Ellen smiles. “No
need for prevarication or sentiment, Chandos. There is no money. You
must close the tubes.” He turns and folds his hands in
supplication. “Treasury, the GPO, have washed their hands of us. Our
creditors have been disbursed. And your usually reliable stream of
patents has, I suspect, been diverted elsewhere.” His eyes are kind. “Inspiration is
fickler than luck. But perhaps—if only to satisfy my curiosity—you
might explain what has occupied you these last six months. A final
report, if you will.”

Ellen pauses. “Flashing light along Holborn. Some bounces back, some
does not.” The Duke demurs. “As you did two years ago?” She
continues. “Indeed. Now, however, lost light is recorded into the
ethylene. Reflected light contains instructions to ‘correct’ the lost
light from previous flashes.” The Duke: “How?” “From transmission
coefficients and phase shifts. They translate into precisely
calibrated magnetic pulses, though we’ve had to extend governor theory
considerably to perform them.” The Duke: “No, I mean, how do you
receive instructions? From who? To what end?” Ellen wrinkles her
nose. “Ah. ‘Instructions’ is Foster's little joke. The artefact by Chancery
Lane seems to change shape unpredictably, as if---I stress I am
being figurative---it is attempting to communicate.” Westminster Abbey, GPO,
the House of Lords, even Madras, fade from the Duke’s mind, resolved
into a single question that will haunt him the rest of his life: “What
<i>is it</i> Ellen?”

The Duke will go to India, win a famine and lose an uprising. Ellen
will return to the tunnels, where, one molecule at a time, she
teleports an object from otherspace.

<p align="center">
Ȣ
  </p>

“My name?” The little man looks puzzled, dons a pair of
spectacles, and mounts the back of the armchair like a
lectern. “According to Rabbinic lore, Solomon bound Ashmedai—Prince of
Demons—with a chain and anklet graven with the tetragrammaton, and
bade him construct the Great Temple. Once finished, Solomon
removed the bindings to see further (one would think superfluous) proof of the demon’s
powers. Ashmedai booted him all the way to Baghdad and usurped him as
king!

Ha.
Enslave a free creature, make it dance, and you'll reap a begoo for your troubles.

“But blood shows; Solomon was discovered from some
impoverished token of his kingship and restored. As for Ashmedai,
accounts differ... In one version, his spirit flees into the air on
Solomon's return, like
so much perfume. In
another, he is trapped by Solomon's magicians in a chamber of rock, wrapped with iron
shackles and cast into the sea.” He
looks around significantly, then shrugs and lies down behind the chair to nap.

“Art thou Ashmedai?”

He peeks out. “Ha! Are you Ellen Watson? Or a scone?”

<i>1875.</i> The hands of the Great Hall’s chronometer are immobile. The
stationmaster dozes—trains delayed by fog—even the bronze likeness of
George Stephenson
drowsy in the vapour. A tremor
passes through the Hall, tugging at naptha flames and stirring dust in the
corners. The stationmaster turns in his chair, mutters an imprecation
upon cheese, and continues dreaming of rarebit and hot rum.

<p align="center">

</p>

The-thing-that-was-once-Ellen wakes up in the twisted,
lightless, and improbably vast
space it has been growing, hundreds of
miles below the tunnels. Once-Ellen has no body. It is a bundle of
threads, interwoven with the rest of universe, rippling with
patterns of attention like colours on a loom.
The loom twitches.
A twitch here: whiskey flowing down Ardee Street, Dublin.
A twitch there: in Menkar, 250 years away, a knot of field lines unravelling as a solar
flare.
A twitch elsewhere: creatures the size of
planets, massing in Eridanus void.

Once-Ellen's patterns start to eat negentropy, transform, will themselves
into matter.
It wills a thistle onto a grave in Kilspindie churchyard. To a
windowsill in Madras, a plate of scones.
It zooms into the ultraviolet and fine-tunes a few signals out of
the lightcone; a girl wakes and takes a black notebook from her
bedside table.
Once-Ellen tires of arrangements, and two colours speak:

The locus splits and asks itself:

*Child, what should you like to do?*

and towards a dark
sky, welcoming in its infinitude.

the inverse rate $r^{-1} \sim 10^3$ for אשמדאי's polarization encipherment, gives

Grant about temperature.) Once he sends the corrections to be applied
(using second encipherment scheme), need to tune and apply the
rotation pulses, with quaternionic form
$$
\mathbf{Q} = -\alpha \mathbf{k} - \beta \left[\mathbf{i}\cos(\omega t + \delta) - \mathbf{j}\cos(\omega t + \delta)\right],

(For LDPC: upgrade induction coils and frequency resolution bank; add another
year and £5K.)
But what happens once the avatar—as he puts it—crosses the entanglement bridge? <br>

*ƕ.* Creatures the size of planetoids keen over the sky,
bristling with teeth and luminescent ruin.
The largest, swollen and multi-limbed, is pursued by a flock of smaller ones, like a
spider by flies.
The spider savages one fly, then another, in huge flickering whips
of light, ingesting them before they can heal.
But there are so many flies; some are attached, leech-like, to its
side, and from open wounds blobs of fluid and disembodied
structure radiate into the void.
It is bleeding to death.
Twelve flies break off from the swarm, forming an icosahedral web
thousands of miles wide.
The spider thrashes, lunges, tries to flee; the web quivers and each
vertex strafes fluidly out of reach.
Slowly, with ritual symmetry, the web pulls closed, folding up
space as it goes. From far off, a star winks out of existence.-->
