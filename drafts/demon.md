All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details were
infinitely beneath the notice of Susan Dewar, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazed with rapture at the fragile and
impossible object before her.

A small shape glowed and hummed in the dark: a patchwork of
triangles, folded in on itself like an origami ball.
Susan gently pulled on a wire near her head, and the tug travelled obediently
into the blackness. A pulley lurched, then another, then a
third, and a cantilevered armature covered in coils and hissing ribbons of
piping leaned forward, as if bowing.
The ball grew larger and a constellation of twelve teardrops appeared around
it, dancing, Susan thought, like angels on the head of a pin.
But then the teardrops lengthened inward into spikes, impaling the
ball through its corners, and Susan gasped.
The spikes pushed through to the opposite side, and the whole figure
convulsed, shivering into new, more elaborate patchworks, the ball
swallowed up by its dancing assailants.

A devilish shape, she concluded, grinning, and switched it off.

*1860*. A little girl is seen to wander Aberdeen's Trinity Quay, fascinating by the
changing shape of the waves. "Where's the go o' that?" she asks
passersby. They do not know.

In the 1860s, the London Pneumatic Despatch Company raised the extravagant sum of
£150,000 to build an underground network of pneumatic tubes for
distributing London's mail.
Construction commenced in 1863 with a short experimental stretch between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile distant.
The network made it as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
its ultimate terminus: unfavourable market conditions. Although the Post
Office used it in a desultory fashion for a few years, like a child
with a poor toy for which it has no alternative,
the network was officially
discontinued in 1874.

But a company ambitious enough to propose an underground pneumatic
network could not reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings would be confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they were forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus that seemed unrelated to the pneumatics of the despatch tubes.
Engineers and builders only saw small parts of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections were at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who kept asking were let go.
Though the network was abandoned, something bigger was already finished.

*1865*. Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of even more debts than titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
One of these men confides that a phenomenon is afoot: a lass, no more
 than ten, a protege of Prof. Thomson and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach", is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the cold.
 
"Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces the young "Miss Dewar" as an
 "exceedingly keen pupil of the modern developments", folds himself into a
 chair in the front row, and motions her to begin.
 Miss Dewar coughs nervously, receives a paternal nod from her mentor,
 and starts in a high, calm, clear voice:
 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px

 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Dynamical Theory of Gravity United with Electromagnetism by an
Additional Dimension of Space</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 sought to explain mutual action of bodies at a distance by the
hypothesis of an electromagnetic field. I will essay to develop a similar
theory for Newton's theory of gravity, which not only provides a medium by
which massive objects may act reciprocally upon one another when separated,
but by the supposition of an additional spatial dimension, leads to
departures from electromagnetic theory itself which we might detect
by suitably precise experimental work...
</font>
</div>
The talk is largely gibberish to the duke. The play of symbols, the
contrivance and subtlety of reasoning, its flashes of scientific
wit, are all lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Dewar's eyes, a flame which kindles something in
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
Like Davie Thomson in that cramped room in Cromwell Tower, her disquisition can barely
contain it.

And so the duke---disappointed in politics, business, himself and the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Susan accepts.
