*1875.* All the prosaic details of that dreary afternoon---sky alternating between bruised peach and
gravecloth---rain imminent---the coach horses, champing and steaming
in their oiled leather beneath Euston Arch---and now the stationmaster,
taking a quick swig and eyeing the coffered vault of
the Great Hall with mindless curiosity---all these details are
infinitely beneath the notice of Ellen Watson, who, 200
yards directly below the stationmaster's rum, gazes with rapture at the fragile and
impossible shape before her.
Induction coils hum, and a hundred electromagnets, scattered across
London and girding their halocarbon alembics, sing a great shadow into being.

So, Ellen thinks, this is how you summon a demon.

changing shape of the waves. "Ciamar?"<label for="sn-4"

<span class="sidenote">How?</span> she asks passersby. They do not
know.
An old man arrives from Marischal Street, ruddy and out of
breath. "Child," he cries, then cracks into a smile: "What have you
found now?"

<p align="center">

*1874.* The General Post Office pays the London
Pneumatic Despatch Company the extravagant sum of
£200,000 to build an underground distribution system: <!--mile-long-->
tunnels of narrow gauge rail, emptied by 20-foot wide iron turbines,
and shooting capsules like bullets with inrushing air.
Construction commences in 1863 with a successful test run between Euston Square and the North
West District Post Office, a third of a mile hence.
The tubes make it past Holborn, and as far as the General Post Office on St Martin's
le Grand, a few years later and miles southwest, before arriving at
their ultimate terminus: a bear market. Although the Post
Office uses the tubes for a couple of years, they run at a loss, and the system is officially retired.

But a company ambitious enough to propose a subterranean network of
pneumatic tubes cannot reasonably be expected to stop there.
Visitors to the diggings are confused by seemingly unnecessary
tunnels, forks they are forbidden from taking, and huge, humming
pieces of apparatus unconnected to the turbines and the cacophonous
engines which drive them.
Engineers and builders are given only fragments of the blueprint.
Questions about other sections are at first politely, then firmly,
discouraged, and those who keep asking are let go.
A young woman is rumored to wander about
and attend to the machines.
The network is abandoned, but a larger enterprise continues.

*1865.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, Third Duke of Buckingham and
 Chandos, heir of as many debts as titles, weary, honest, but not without his
 moments of shrewdness, visits the University of Aberdeen in his
 capacity as Chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to
 consult some engineers.
They share a corker: a lass, no more
 than ten, a ward of Auld Dauvit and, one mutters darkly, a "leanabh breugach",<label for="sn-1"

  Illegitimate child.
</span> is giving a lecture
 on natural philosophy.
 The Duke is intrigued---he has a daughter the same age---and finds
 himself laboriously ascending the granite steps of Cromwell Tower the
 next morning, curiosity more powerful than the biting lowland cold.
 
Auld "Davie" Thomson, an immense, stentorian don who must stoop to enter
 the classroom, introduces "Miss Watson" as an
 "exceedingly sharp pupil of the modern developments". He folds himself into a
 chair in the front row and tenderly motions her to begin.
 Miss Watson coughs nervously, and after another paternal nod,
 addresses the room in a high, calm, clear voice:
 <div style="width=75%; background-color: #fffff8 ; padding: 0px 30px; border: 0px
solid black; line-height:1.3;">
 <font size="-0.2">
<b>A Unified Dynamical Theory of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</b> <br>

Maxwell's treatise of 1864 explained the mutual influence of
charged or magnetised bodies at a distance by
hypothesising an electromagnetic field. I will adapt this method
to Newton's law of gravity, which not only provides a medium for
massive objects to act reciprocally upon one another without action at
a distance, but by supposing an additional spatial dimension (cf. Möbius,
Riemann, Hamilton &c), furnishes a
mechanism to unify gravity and electromagnetism...
</font>
</div>
The talk is gibberish to the Duke. The play of symbols, the
twined threads of argument, its flashes of scientific
wit, are lost on him; what is not lost, however, is the flame of
living joy in Miss Watson's eyes, a flame which kindles
his own dim embers and threatens to engulf the room.
It is both childlike and strangely unchildlike; it has something of
the Old Testament prophet or the Greek philosopher in it.
Like Davie Thomson in the cramped space of Cromwell Tower, her small
frame can barely contain it.

And so the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos---disappointed in politics, business, himself, the whole
backward scheme of his life---formulates the terms of an offer he will
later describe as "inspired lunacy". Ellen accepts.

*1861.* The study overlooks the gentle slopes of Kilspindie glen. The
 reverend leans on his chestnut bureau: a hymnary, some notes in Gaelic,
 a lump of amygdule sparkling with calcite. His eyes are kind.
 "Child, what should you like to do? The schoolmaster tells me he can
 teach you nothing."

*1869.* In the Beethoven Rooms of 76 Harley
Street, Professor Carey Foster anxiously regards the bluestockings who have
assembled to learn thermodynamics.
Ludwig van glowers at him from the wall.
"Heat"---he pauses, steadies himself, and tries to speak over the
disapproval of the portrait---"heat, ladies, is not merely those sensible properties
of a teapot or a fireplace with which we are all familiar, and
therefore strike us as too commonplace to merit discussion. Heat
lives in the realm of measurable phenomena; its very sensibility is
evidence of its effects. If measurable, it must admit of precise
determination. In these lectures, we will learn how these
determinations are made, and the physical basis on which they rest. We
will cover thermometry, calorimetry, and the basic dynamical
principles governing the evolution of a thermodynamic system---like our
friend the teapot."
He smiles and looks around the room. "Let us start with the
definition of temperature..."

After the lecture and questions are finished, Foster is packing
his valise when a young girl approaches. Is she lost? She does not
look lost. "Professor Foster, I wonder if I might have a moment of
your time?" Bright and fearless; intriguing. "Of course child. How
might I assist?" She proffers a notebook.
"I have been carrying out researches into the optical properties of
magnetised fluids." He restrains himself from laughing at the absurdity. "In what connection? And
how, forgive me, could you possibly get access to the necessary
equipment?" He leafs theatrically through the notebook. Scribbles.

She explains as if it was as unremarkable as the teapot. "I am employed
by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company to do so---much more
besides---considerable resources at my disposal, and so on. But to the point: are you familiar with Maxwell's paper on
the theory of governors, the mechanical contrivance by which a uniform
velocity of rotation is maintained, in a turbine for example?
I think we might apply these notions to 'corpuscular machines',
but the finer points of experimental chemistry elude me. I
remember you stating in your lectures on
acoustics that you studied with Kekulé?" The notebook becomes suddenly clear, swimming before him
in equations, engineering schematics, reaction pathways, scattered
exclamations of EYPHKA!
The absurdity has somewhat changed character.

Beethoven looks on with amusement. Foster stammers:
"Corpuscular machines? Ah, you mean molecules. Perhaps..." Evening traffic floats in from
Marleybone. "Perhaps you would like
some tea?"

*1873.* Passengers waft like autumn leaves through the doubled cube of the Hall.
A doctor from Boxmoor talks about the Factory Act and ladies studying medicine---a mother of three
chases little William, who shrieks with delight---beneath the allegorical statuary, where nobody watches, a boy in
shabby clothes curls up and sleeps.
All this commotion, the comings and goings, arrivals and leavetakings,
chaos and heartbreak and tobacco smoke, blur into a kind of
stillness, modulated only by the rhythm of the timetable.
Humans on average.

Ellen as usual does not enter the Great Hall.
Instead, she has resolved a disagreement with Foster
about the electromagnetic shadow of a sphere, and walks briskly from the student
laboratory of University College to Eversholt Street.
She ducks into a culvert, unlocks a small service door, and lights the
moderator lamp kept on a hook by the entrance.
The elevator, once summoned, clanks croakingly up like an oversized
frog and gulps her into its wrought-iron mouth.
As it begins the slow descent to the
tunnels, the hum of coils and windings gets louder, and
Ellen feels as if she is becoming her true self once more: a self
which expands through the old network, which winds in arcs of jagged light
through the despatch tubes, reflectors, and magnetized colloids.

The frog disgorges her at a junction of six tunnels, a few meters
across and choked with machinery. Ellen puts the lamp on a cluttered
desk and begins checking the instruments, adjusting,
configuring, jotting down readings, pulling on wires which
radiate from the junction into the dark of other machine banks.
She is about to start the vacuum cycle, but intuition---that
melodious voice which, not hers, has yet always accompanied
her---suggests to check the readings again.
There is a small discrepancy from the Holborn interferometer.
She does a quick calculation---guided by the voice---and finds the
results are consistent with reversing one of the polarizations.

She knows the arrangement of reflectors better than the
veins in her hand; a stray reflection is impossible.
She pauses for a moment.
Parsimony suggests that it is not a stray reflection, but a mirror in
some "otherspace" she cannot see.
Ellen gathers her lamp, compass, and notepad, and tramps off into
the tunnels to learn the precise bearings of the fourth dimension.

*1873.* An envelope, ironically delivered by coach, arrives on the
 chairman's desk; a welcome distraction from negotiations with the
 GPO. Inside:

</div>

Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville
chuckles, thinking of that frigid morning in Aberdeen and all its corollaries.
He skips past patents and maintainance summaries to the yearly
planning, which includes the item:

</font>
</div>

Not, the Duke supposes, a large dead rat in the Holborn despatch tube again.
It must be---as Ellen had hoped---an artifact, hovering near
Chancery Lane in a direction that no lawyer, however advanced his
legal sophistry, could point to.

<p align="center">

  </p>

Ȣ. In a dream, Ellen returns to Trinity Quay. It is like
 childhood, but bathed in a gentle greyness, as if the light cannot quite touch
 the objects it falls upon.
 A small rowboat is moored where the Kirkland ferry usually
 departs.
 Ellen is drawn ineluctably towards it, and immediately, without effort, it begins to move, gaining
 speed from Victoria dock into the turning basin, and then outwards,
 outwards to the North Sea.
 Now they are hurtling, the oars
 flat in the rowlocks and skimming the water, she and the boat one breathless motion.
Facing backwards, the frozen
light of Aberdeen grows smaller; beneath, the mild swell of the wave
which bears them onwards.

The dream lurches.
Ellen is moored on the other side of a craggy, rough-hewn
breakwater which reaches into the sky and hides Aberdeen behind it.
The breakwater encloses an island, and at its crown show the outlines of a Chancery
Lane shopfront: Ede & Ravenscroft, tailors by royal appointment of His
Majesty.
She moves closer, and the store blooms into color, sweeping her view
beneath its trefoiled architrave, past the juridical wigs and
robes and orders of chivalry,
and up the stairs to a humble bedroom lit only by the embers of a dying fire.

The little Rumpelstiltskin man sits in a green armchair, all tatters,
devouring a scone. His eyes bulge, and beads of sweat glisten
dully on his forehead. She senses they have been talking for
hours.
There is a plate of crumbs beside them.
"Why, what a thoughtless begoo I am! Guests should not go hungry at
the Ashen House. Ha!"
The little man clicks his
fingers and the crumbs assemble into a scone.
<!--The logs in the fire crackle and brightly unburn.--> "I may have borrowed a
dollop of negentropy," he says sheepishly.

Another lurch. Ellen wakes with three white hairs.

*1875.* Richard Plantagenet Campbell
 Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville stands in his old LPDC
 office, empty but for a chestnut bureau and a box of yellowing reports. Through the window, he can
 see the twin giants of Westminster towering over Dean's Yard. He has that air of
 abstraction and regret that so often hovers about men of station;
 he has just learned from Disraeli that he will govern Madras.
 Luck never seemed to him personified by a Lady, but rather a
 profligate and wastrel Lord, who giveth or taketh depending on his
 humour, and in whose service each of us is, from time to time, dragooned.

A knock at the door. "Ah, Miss Watson. Come in." Ellen enters briskly; the Duke
continues to gaze at Hawksmoor's giants. "I remember your talk at
Aberdeen ten years ago. I understood nothing, except that, like Atlas, with a little
leverage you could move the world." Ellen smiles. "No need for prevarication or
sentiment, Chandos. There is no money. You must close the tubes." He turns and
folds his hands in supplication. "Treasury, the GPO, have washed their
hands of us. Our creditors have been disbursed. And your usually reliable stream of patents has,
it seems, dried up." His eyes are kind. "Inspiration is fickler than luck. But
perhaps—if only to satisfy my curiosity—you might explain what has
occupied you these last six months. A final report."

Ellen pauses. "Flashing light along Holborn. Some bounces back, some
 does not." The Duke demurs. "As you did two years ago?"
 She continues. "Indeed. Now, however, lost light is recorded into the
 ethylene. Reflected light contains instructions to 'correct' the lost
 light from previous flashes." The Duke: "How?" "From transmission
 coefficients and phase shifts. They translate into precisely
 calibrated magnetic pulses, though we've had to extend
 governor theory considerably to perform them."
 The Duke: "No, I mean, how do you receive instructions? From who? To what
 end?" Ellen wrinkles her nose. "I use 'instructions'
 figuratively. The scheme 'tells me' the shape of the artifact by Chancery Lane."
Westminster Abbey, GPO, the House of Lords, even Madras, fade from the
Duke's mind, resolved into a single question that
will haunt him until he dies: "What *is* it Ellen?" Her nose
 wrinkles again: "I'm afraid we will never know."

The Duke will go to India, win a famine and lose an uprising. Ellen will return to the tunnels, where,
one molecule at a time, she teleports a demon out of otherspace.

<p align="center">

Ȣ. "My name?" The little man looks puzzled, dons a pair of spectacles,
 and mounts the back of the armchair like a lectern. "According to
 Rabbinic lore, Solomon bound Ashmedai—Prince of Demons—with a chain and anklet graven with the
 tetragrammaton, and bade him construct the great temple.
 Once complete, Solomon removed the bindings to see a further
 demonstration of the demon's powers. Ashmedai flung him a thousand
 miles away and usurped him as king! Curiosity is a right begoo.

"But
 the Rabbis recognized him from some impoverished token of his
 kingship.
As for Ashmedai, accounts differ. The <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> tells us
 that his spirit fled into the air on Solomon's return. Perhaps he
 tired of the caper and longed for freedom... In the Islamic
 tradition, he was trapped in a chamber of rock, encircled with iron
 shackles and cast into the sea. Like us here!" He removes his spectacles and
 collapses melodramatically behind the chair.

"Art thou Ashmedai?"

He peeks out. "Ha! Are you Ellen Watson? Or a scone?"

 Demons—was trapped in a chamber of rock, encircled by iron

*1876.* The hands of the Great Hall's chronometer, in its proud armature of polished
 brass, seem immobile. The stationmaster
 dozing---trains delayed by fog---the motley of passengers adrowse or
 reading, their newspapers wilted with damp---naptha flares at midday---and
 even the bronze likeness of George
 Stephenson, that commanding and self-willed Patrician of the Rail, sound asleep.
 A harrowing, low-pitched screech is muffled by the vapour.
 The stationmaster turns in his chair, mutters an imprecation upon cheese, and
 continues dreaming of rarebit and hot rum.
 Will dynamically constituting matter.

<!--In the tunnels beneath Euston Square, a wormhole winks out of existence.-->

Ȣ. The-thing-that-was-once-Ellen wakes up in the twisted, lightless,
and improbably vast space it has been growing, hundreds of miles
below the tunnels.
Once-Ellen has no body.
It is a programmable supply of connections to the rest of universe,
with an
attentional locus that can choose to spread, concentrate or divide at will.
It imagines an arm; dirt, water and air congeal muddily into
a limb.
It imagines fire; oxygen sublimes and ignites, while the
surface of the chamber grows uniformly cooler.

The locus splits and asks itself:

*Child, what should you like to do?*

<div style="text-align: right">
<i>Tilleadh. I will see the stars again.</i>
</div>

And at the speed of thought, once-Ellen moves through earth and
water, the ash of plenum, past the warren of despatch tubes and the
Great Hall in all its soporific grandeur, towards an endless sky, <!-- full of unfamiliar
suns and--> welcoming in its infinitude.

<!--Ȣ. The currents are stilled; the ocean a mirror of welcoming infinitude.
Ellen leaves her new friends by the breakwater and returns to the tunnels beneath
the House.
<i>What have you found now?</i>
One of a thousand doors leads to Euston; each door leading
to a thousand tunnels, stretched in webs of otherspace and undisentanglable complexity
across the bright whorl of the galaxy.
Expanding through the network, she feels as if she is becoming her true self once more.-->

<!--Ellen wonders if it was not curiosity that led
her here, but some sort of structural inevitability in the fabric of
things, a potential well deep enough to counter the barrier in otherspace...

<!--The portal from Euston leads to a twisted, lightless and improbably
vast space beneath Ashen House, where the king readies his procession.

<!--A voice slithers around her in the dark:

Something ancient, bristling with teeth and luminescent ruin.

flew into the sky, making haste his escape.-->

traces, for nothing suitably complex can be destroyed.

the inverse rate $r^{-1} \sim 10^3$ for אשמדאי's polarization encipherment, gives

Grant about temperature.) Once he sends the corrections to be applied
(using second encipherment scheme), need to tune and apply the
rotation pulses, with quaternionic form

year and £5K.)

*ƕ.* Creatures the size of planetoids keen over the sky,
bristling with teeth and luminescent ruin.
The largest, swollen and multi-limbed, is pursued by a flock of smaller ones, like a
spider by flies.
The spider savages one fly, then another, in huge flickering whips
of light, ingesting them before they can heal.
But there are so many flies; some are attached, leech-like, to its
side, and from open wounds blobs of fluid and disembodied
structure radiate into the void.
It is bleeding to death.
Twelve flies break off from the swarm, forming an icosahedral web
thousands of miles wide.
The spider thrashes, lunges, tries to flee; the web quivers and each
vertex strafes fluidly out of reach.
Slowly, with ritual symmetry, the web pulls closed, folding up
space as it goes. From far off, a star winks out of existence.-->
