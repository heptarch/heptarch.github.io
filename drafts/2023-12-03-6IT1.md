your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”<br>

Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog in a semi-regular fashion on a few different "finds"
(nominally six) in science and technology every fortnight or so. This may end up being way
too ambitious! But I'm hoping to be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather
than thorough and technically deep; more pop than classical. Let's see how it goes!

<h2>I. Art galleries with walls</h2>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
	   In this wonderful book, Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler
	   present proofs so elegant that God themself might
	   approve. Whether an omniscient being needs proofs is a topic
	   for another time.
	   </span>
that \lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and a simple example shows
this number is also necessary. We'll start with the
example. Basically, we take $n$ triangles and connect them with a corridor:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="500"/>
	<figcaption><i>Galleries that require $n/3$ guards.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard (to see the tip) and one guard can
survey the corridor, and the leftmost triangle, from the bottom-left corner.
