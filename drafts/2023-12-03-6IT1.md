Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog about some number of "finds" in math, physics, or
machine learning (nominally six) on a semi-regular (nominally monthly) basis. These
may be new papers, old papers, discoveries, or shower thoughts; six may still end up
being too ambitious. But I'm hoping to be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather
than thorough and technically deep. Let's see how it goes!

## 1. <a href="#tbc"> Art galleries and the OSH theorem</a><a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"

	   </span>
that $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and examples show
this number is in general necessary. We'll start with the
example. Basically, we take $m$ triangles and connect them with a
corridor, forming a gallery of $n=3m$ walls. We illustrate with $m = 3$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard to see the recessed tip, but one of
these guards can survey the whole corridor from the bottom left.
Thus, $m = n/3$ guards are needed. For $n$ not a mulitple of $3$, we
can simply remove one or two walls from the above construction.
Now let's turn to Fisk's argument
for sufficiency.

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<b>Art gallery theorem.</b> For a polygonal gallery of $n$ walls, $\lfloor
n/3 \rfloor$ guards are sufficient.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> Consider the graph formed by the $n$ walls of the gallery, with
 walls as edges and the points they meet as vertices. Triangulate this graph,
 i.e. introduce $n - 2$ new rectilinear edges that split the interior
 into triangles. We will show that we can color the vertices of this
 graph with three colors so that no adjacent vertex has the same
 color.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards4.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Note that, since there are no internal vertices, we can
 assign $0$ and $1$ in an alternating fashion to triangular faces.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   If we could not assign bits this way, it would mean an odd number
 of triangular faces meet at a point. This is only possible with
 internal vertices.
	   </span> We color
 the faces assigned $0$ with three colors (G, R, B) in clockwise order, and
 faces assigned $1$ with the colors in counterclockwise order, with
 the first face determining the coloring of the second face, and so
 on. The coloring clearly exists and is unique up to the choice of
 triangulation and ordering on the first face.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards2.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Running around the polygon, we have $n$ vertices of three
 colors, the rarest of which is assigned to at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$
 vertices. If it was assigned to more, there would be more than
 $n$ vertices!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards3.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

We choose this rare color to be the location of our guards. Since each
triangle has a vertex of this color, each triangle has a guard
watching it, and we are done.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
The required triangulation doesn't
obviously exist for non-convex polygons. To show it does, first we
need the existence of a vertex with acute interior angle, like the
leftmost corner above. Without such a vertex, the polygon could never
close! So, let's draw this vertex:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards8.svg" width="200"/>
	</div>
	</figure>
	
We can either tringulate by drawing an edge between the two
adjacent vertices, or if a vertex pokes inside that triangle, to the
offending poker. Then we split off the triangle and use induction on
the rest!
</span> $\blacksquare$
</div>

I became interested in the art gallery theorem because of a real world
problem: supervision in out-of-school-hours (OSH) care. Instead of
guards watching over paintings, there are educators watching over
children, which in contrast to paintings are mobile and
unpredictable. The requirement of full visibility makes more sense!
My sister coordinates an OSH facility with an almost comically elaborate
layout.
The standard art gallery theorem does not apply due to the presence of
*internal polygons*.
Let us these call internal walls or polygons *holes*.
With a little thought, one can extend to the art gallery theorem to
the following:

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<b>OSH theorem.</b> For a polygonal OSH layout of $n$ total walls and $g$
holes, a total of

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{n+2g}{3}\right\rfloor
$$

educators are sufficient to supervise the whole space.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> For each hole, draw an edge from one of its vertices to
a vertex on the outer polygon.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards5.svg" width="400"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

If each such edge is viewed as
<i>two</i> walls, we now have a (non-convex) polygon of $n + 2g$ walls,
and we can apply the original art gallery theorem.
$\blacksquare$
</div>

This was first proved by O'Rourke (see Chapter 5 of his book).
Examples of necessity are much harder to come by.
We can modify our earlier examples by adding walls, which we view as
degenerate polygons of $2$ walls.
For instance, the following OSH layout, with $n = 7$ and $g = 1$,
requires $(n + 2g)/3 = 3$ educators:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards6.svg" width="200"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Adding more slits and recesses, we can extend this to higher values of $n$ and $g$.
But these degenerate  polygons seem like cheating,<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
After all, they can only hide a child of measure zero from a
well-positioned supervisor.
</span>
and if we require genuine polygons, it becomes much harder to saturate the bound; for
general $n$ and $g$, the problem is unsolved. There is a
characterization of such polygons for a *single* hole (due to Sherman)
that is very fiddly, and gives rise to constructions like the following
($n=40$ walls and $14$ guards):

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards7.svg" width="230"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

This would not look out of place in a basilica or medieval fortress.
It is remarkable that that adding internal walls makes the task so
much harder; then again, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that
supervising large groups of children gives rise to unsolvable problems.
