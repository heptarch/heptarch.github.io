your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”<br>

Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog in a semi-regular fashion on a few different "finds"
(nominally six) in science and technology every fortnight or so. This may end up being way
too ambitious! But I'm hoping to be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather
than thorough and technically deep; more pop than classical. Let's see how it goes!

<h2>I. The Aftercare Theorem</h2>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"

	   approve. Whether an omniscient being needs proofs is a topic
	   for another time.

that $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and a simple example shows
this number is also necessary. We'll start with the
example. Basically, we take $m$ triangles and connect them with a
corridor, forming a gallery of $n=3m$ walls. We illustrate with $m = 3$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 10px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard to see the recessed tip, but one of
these guards can survey the whole corridor from the bottom left.
Thus, $m = n/3$ guards are needed. Now let's turn to Fisk's argument
for sufficiency.

**Art gallery theorem.** For a polygonal gallery of $n$ walls, $\lceil
n/3 \rceil$ guards are sufficient.

<div style="background-color: #2e303b ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> Consider the graph formed by the $n$ walls of the gallery, with
 walls as edges and the points they meet as vertices. Triangulate this graph,
 i.e. introduce $n - 2$ new rectilinear edges that split the interior
 into triangles. We will show that we can color the vertices of this
 graph with three colors so that no adjacent vertex has the same
 color.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 10px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards2.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The Book proof uses induction, but here's a little variant I
 came up with. Note that, since there are no internal vertices, we can
 assign $0$ and $1$ in an alternating fashion to triangular faces. We color
 the $0$ faces with three colors (G, R, B) clockwise, and $1$ faces
 with the colors in counterclockwise order, with the first face
 determining all remaining assignments.
