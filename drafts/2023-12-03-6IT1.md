Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog in a semi-regular fashion on a few different "finds"
(nominally six) in science and technology every fortnight or so. This may end up being way
too ambitious! But I'm hoping to be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather
than thorough and technically deep; more pop than classical. Let's see how it goes!

## 1. Art galleries and the OSH theorem<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">

	   </span>
that $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and a simple example shows
this number is also necessary. We'll start with the
example. Basically, we take $m$ triangles and connect them with a
corridor, forming a gallery of $n=3m$ walls. We illustrate with $m = 3$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard to see the recessed tip, but one of
these guards can survey the whole corridor from the bottom left.
Thus, $m = n/3$ guards are needed. For $n$ not a mulitple of $3$, we
can simply remove one or two walls from the above construction.
Now let's turn to Fisk's argument
for sufficiency.

**Art gallery theorem.** For a polygonal gallery of $n$ walls, $\lfloor
n/3 \rfloor$ guards are sufficient.

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> Consider the graph formed by the $n$ walls of the gallery, with
 walls as edges and the points they meet as vertices. Triangulate this graph,
 i.e. introduce $n - 2$ new rectilinear edges that split the interior
 into triangles. We will show that we can color the vertices of this
 graph with three colors so that no adjacent vertex has the same
 color.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards4.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Note that, since there are no internal vertices, we can
 assign $0$ and $1$ in an alternating fashion to triangular faces.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   If we could not assign bits this way, it would mean an odd number
 of triangular faces meet at a point. This is only possible with
 internal vertices.
	   </span> We color
 the faces assigned $0$ with three colors (G, R, B) in clockwise order, and
 faces assigned $1$ with the colors in counterclockwise order, with
 the first face determining the coloring of the second face, and so
 on. The coloring clearly exists and is unique up to the choice of
 triangulation and ordering on the first face.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards2.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Running around the polygon, we have $n$ vertices of three
 colors, the rarest of which is assigned to at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$
 vertices. If it was assigned to more, there would be more than
 $n$ vertices!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards3.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

We choose this rare color to be the location of our guards. Since each
triangle has a vertex of this color, each triangle has a guard
watching it, and we are done.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
The required triangulation doesn't
obviously exist for non-convex polygons. To show it does, first we
need the existence of a vertex with acute interior angle, like the
leftmost corner above. Without such a vertex, the polygon could never
close! Given that it exists, we either draw a triangle with the two
adjacent vertices, or if a vertex pokes inside that triangle, to the
offending poker. Then we split off the triangle and use induction on
the rest!

I became interested in the art gallery theorem because of a real world
problem: supervision in out-of-school-hours (OSH) care. Instead of
guards watching over paintings, there are educators watching over
children; unlike paintings, children are mobile and
unpredictable, so the requirement of full visibility makes sense!
My sister coordinates an OSH facility with an almost comically elaborate
layout.
The standard art gallery theorem does not apply due to the presence of
*internal polygons*.
Let us these call internal walls or polygons *holes*.
With a little thought, one can extend to the art gallery theorem to
the following:

**OSH theorem.** For a polygonal OSH layout of $n$ total walls and $g$
holes, a total of

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{n+2g}{3}\right\rfloor
$$

educators are sufficient to supervise the whole space.

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> For each hole, draw an edge from one of its vertices to
a vertex on the outer polygon.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards5.svg" width="400"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

If each such edge is viewed as
<i>two</i> walls, we now have a (non-convex) polygon of $n + 2g$ walls,
and we can apply the original art gallery theorem.
■
</div>

This was first proved by O'Rourke (see Chapter 5 of his book).
Constructing examples of necessity takes a little more effort.
We can modify our earlier examples by adding walls, which we have
to view as degenerate polygons of size $2$.
For instance, the following OSH layout, with $n = 7$ and $g = 1$,
requires $(n + 2g)/3 = 3$ educators:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards6.svg" width="170"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Adding more slits and recesses, we can extend this to higher values of $n$ and $g$!
However, if we are restricted to genuine polygons, rather than
degenerate walls,<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
Which after all, can only hide children of measure zero from a
well-positioned supervisor.
</span>
it becomes much harder to find instances which saturate the bound; for
general $n$ and $g$, the problem is unsolved. Even the
characterization of such polygons for a *single* hole (due to Sherman)
is rather Byzantine, giving rise to constructions like the following
($n=40$ with $(n+2g)/3 = 14$ guards) which would not look out of place
in a study of medieval fortifications:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards7.svg" width="250"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Then again, is anyone surprised that supervising groups of children
gives rise to unsolvable problems?
