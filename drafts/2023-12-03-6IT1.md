Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog in a semi-regular fashion on a few different "finds"
(nominally six) in science and technology every fortnight or so. This may end up being way
too ambitious! But I'm hoping to be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather
than thorough and technically deep; more pop than classical. Let's see how it goes!

## 1. Art galleries and the OSH theorem<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">

	   </span>
that $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and a simple example shows
this number is also necessary. We'll start with the
example. Basically, we take $m$ triangles and connect them with a
corridor, forming a gallery of $n=3m$ walls. We illustrate with $m = 3$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard to see the recessed tip, but one of
these guards can survey the whole corridor from the bottom left.
Thus, $m = n/3$ guards are needed. Now let's turn to Fisk's argument
for sufficiency.

**Art gallery theorem.** For a polygonal gallery of $n$ walls, $\lfloor
n/3 \rfloor$ guards are sufficient.

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> Consider the graph formed by the $n$ walls of the gallery, with
 walls as edges and the points they meet as vertices. Triangulate this graph,
 i.e. introduce $n - 2$ new rectilinear edges that split the interior
 into triangles. We will show that we can color the vertices of this
 graph with three colors so that no adjacent vertex has the same
 color.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards4.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Note that, since there are no internal vertices, we can
 assign $0$ and $1$ in an alternating fashion to triangular faces.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   If we could not assign bits this way, it would mean an odd number
 of triangular faces meet at a point. This is only possible with
 internal vertices.
	   </span> We color
 the faces assigned $0$ with three colors (G, R, B) in clockwise order, and
 faces assigned $1$ with the colors in counterclockwise order, with
 the first face determining the coloring of the second face, and so
 on. The coloring clearly exists and is unique up to the choice of
 triangulation and ordering on the first face.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards2.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Running around the outside the polygon, we have $n$ vertices of three
 colors, the rarest of which is assigned to at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$
 vertices. If the rarest was assigned to more, we would have more than
 $n$ vertices!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards3.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

We choose this rare color to be the location of our guards Since each
triangle has a vertex of this color, each triangle has a guard
watching it, and we are done.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
The required triangulation doesn't
obviously exist for non-convex polygons. To show it does, first we
need the existence of a vertex with acute interior angle, like the
leftmost corner above. Without such a vertex, the polygon could never
close! Given that it exists, we either draw a triangle with the two
adjacent vertices, or if a vertex pokes inside that triangle, to the
offending poker. Then we split off the triangle and use induction on
the rest!

**Exercise 1.1.** Show that a gallery with $n$
  orthogonal walls needs at least $\lfloor n/4 \rfloor$ guards.

I became interested in the art gallery theorem because of its
connection to a real world problem: out-of-school-hours (OSH)
care, where the requirement of full visibility makes far more sense. My sister coordinates an OSH facility with a
layout so complex it literally invites mathematical analysis!
A crucial difference from the standard art gallery theorem is the
existence of *internal walls*, which obscure visibility within the
space. We draw an unsupervised "red zone" below.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards5.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Let us these internal polygons *holes*.
With a little thought, one can extend to the art gallery theorem to
the following:

**OSH theorem.** For a polygonal OSH layout of $n$ total walls and $g$
holes, a total of

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n+2g}{3}\right\rfloor
\]

educators are sufficient to supervise the whole space.
