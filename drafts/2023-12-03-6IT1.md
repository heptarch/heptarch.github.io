Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog about some number of "finds" in math, physics, or
machine learning (nominally six) on a semi-regular (nominally monthly) basis. These
may be new papers, old papers, discoveries, or shower thoughts; my
nomimal goals may still end up being too ambitious. But I'm hoping to
be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather than thorough and technically deep. Let's see how it goes!

## 1. <a href="#tbc"> Art galleries and the OSH theorem</a><a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Suppose you have to guard an art gallery with $n$ straight walls. How many guards do you need
to ensure the artworks are visible at all times? There is a beautiful
proof, due to Steve Fisk and presented
[Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8),<label for="sn-1"

	   approve. Whether an omniscient being needs proofs is another question!
	   </span>
that $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficent, and examples show
this number is in general necessary. We'll start with the
examples. Take $m$ triangles and connect them with a
corridor, forming a gallery of $n=3m$ walls. For $m = 3$, this gives:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards1.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each triangle requires a guard to see the recessed tip, but one of
these guards can survey the whole corridor from the bottom left.
Thus, $m = n/3$ guards are needed. For $n$ not a multiple of $3$, we
can simply remove one or two walls from the above construction.
Now let's turn to Fisk's argument
for sufficiency.

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Art Gallery Theorem.</span> For a polygonal gallery of $n$ walls, $\lfloor
n/3 \rfloor$ guards are sufficient.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> Consider the graph formed by the $n$ walls of the gallery, with
 walls as edges and the points they meet as vertices. Triangulate this graph,
 i.e. introduce $n - 2$ new rectilinear edges that split the interior
 into triangles. We will show that we can color the vertices of this
 graph with three colors so that no adjacent vertex has the same
 color.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards4.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Note that, since there are no internal vertices, we can
 assign $0$ and $1$ in an alternating fashion to triangular faces.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   If we could not assign bits this way, it would mean an odd number
 of triangular faces meet at a point. This is only possible with
 internal vertices.
	   </span> We color
 the faces assigned $0$ with three colors (G, R, B) in clockwise order, and
 faces assigned $1$ with the colors in counterclockwise order, with
 the first face determining the coloring of the second face, and so
 on. The coloring clearly exists and is unique up to the choice of
 triangulation and ordering on the first face.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards2.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Running around the polygon, we have $n$ vertices of three
 colors, the rarest of which is assigned to at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$
 vertices. If it was assigned to more, there would be more than
 $n$ vertices!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards3.svg" width="300"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

We choose this rare color to be the location of our guards. Since each
triangle has a vertex of this color, each triangle has a guard
watching it, and we are done.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
The required triangulation doesn't
obviously exist for non-convex polygons. To show it does, first we
need the existence of a vertex with acute interior angle, like the
leftmost corner above. Without such a vertex, the polygon could never
close! So, let's draw this vertex:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards8.svg" width="200"/>
	</div>
	</figure>
	
We can either tringulate by drawing an edge between the two
adjacent vertices, or if a vertex pokes inside that triangle, to the
offending poker. Then we split off the triangle and use induction on
the rest!
</span> $\blacksquare$
</div>

I became interested in the art gallery theorem because of a real world
problem: supervision in out-of-school-hours (OSH) care. Instead of
guards watching over paintings, there are educators watching over
children, which in contrast to paintings are mobile and
unpredictable. The requirement of full visibility makes more sense!
My sister coordinates an OSH facility with an almost comically elaborate
layout.
The standard art gallery theorem does not apply due to the presence of
*internal polygons*.
Let us these call internal walls or polygons *holes*.
With a little thought, one can extend to the art gallery theorem to
the following:

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">OSH Theorem.</span> For a polygonal OSH layout of $n$ total walls and $g$
holes, a total of

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{n+2g}{3}\right\rfloor
$$

educators are sufficient to supervise the whole space.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> For each hole, draw an edge from one of its vertices to
a vertex on the outer polygon.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards5.svg" width="380"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

If each such edge is viewed as
<i>two</i> walls, we now have a (non-convex) polygon of $n + 2g$ walls,
and we can apply the original art gallery theorem.
$\blacksquare$
</div>

This was first proved by O'Rourke (see Chapter 5 of his book).
Examples of necessity are much harder to come by.
We can modify our earlier examples by adding internal walls, which we view as
degenerate polygons of $2$ walls.
For instance, the following OSH layout, with $n = 7$ and $g = 1$,
requires $(n + 2g)/3 = 3$ educators:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards6.svg" width="220"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Adding more slits and recesses, we can extend this to higher values of $n$ and $g$.
But these degenerate  polygons seem like cheating,<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
After all, they can only hide a child of measure zero from a
well-positioned supervisor.
</span>
and if we require genuine polygons, it becomes much harder to saturate the bound; for
general $n$ and $g$, the problem is unsolved. There is a full
characterization of such polygons for a *single* hole (due to Shermer)
that is very fiddly, and gives rise to constructions like the following
($n=40$ walls and $14$ guards):

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 5px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/guards7.svg" width="210"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

This would not look out of place in a basilica or medieval fortress.
It is remarkable that a few walls make the task so
much harder; then again, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that
trying to manage groups of children gives rise to unsolvable
problems.

## 2. <a href="#tbc">Zermelo's demon and the axiom of choice</a><a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

A [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08467) by Baumeler, Dakić, and Del Santo introduced me to a curious
consequence of the axiom of choice (AC).
Recall that the AC states that, for any collection of nonempty sets
$\\{S_i: i\in I\\}$, we can choose a set of representatives
$\\{s_i: i\in I\\}$, where $s_i \in S_i$, i.e. one element from each set.
Though the AC is very intuitive—we can choose elements from nonempty
sets—it has very counterintuitive consequences, such as the
[Banach-Tarski paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_Paradox).

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc1.svg" width="480"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

This splits a perfect sphere into five
wildly complicated pieces, and reassembles them to form *two* spheres of
	   the same size!
In his
[autobiography](https://sistemas.fciencias.unam.mx/~compcuantica/RICHARD%20P.%20FEYNMAN-SURELY%20YOU'RE%20JOKING%20MR.%20FEYNMAN.PDF),
Richard Feynman refutes Banach-Tarski<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

	   <span class="sidenote">
	   Or he mockingly calls it, "So-and-so's theorem of
	   immeasurable measure".
	   </span> on the grounds that no *physical*
sphere, composed of atoms, can be split up this way.
The atoms prevent the arbitrarily fine divisions needed to make the
pieces non-measurable!
One could view this as an argument against the AC, but I think the
point is subtler: since we cannot carry out the Banach-Tarski
"experiment" in reality, we cannot use physics to reason about the axioms of set
theory. The AC could be true, it could be false; physics probably has
nothing to do with it.

Baumeler, Dakić, and Del Santo disagree.
They argue that the AC may have physical implications, using a
bizarre corollary discovered by Gabay and O’Connor in 2004:

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Infinite Hat Theorem.</span>
Suppose a countable number of prisoners are placed on the
number line, one at each natural number, and independently assigned a
blue or red hat with equal probability. We suppose they face forward,
and can see all hats at higher values of $n$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc2.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

If the prisoners meet beforehand, can use the AC, and know their
position on the number line,
they can independently guess the color of their hats so that <i>only a finite number
are wrong</i>.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i>
Consider the set $S = \{\text{R},
\text{B}\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sequences of red and blue
hats. Two sequences $s, s' \in S$ are eventually equal if they have
the form
$$
s = s_0 t, \quad s' = s'_0 t
$$
for some finite sequences $s_0, s_0'$ of equal length, and $t \in S$.
We let $s(n)$ denote the $n$th element of sequence $s$.
It's easy to see that being eventually equal is an
equivalence relation, with equivalence classes $S_i$ for some indexing
set $i \in I$.
By the AC, the prisoners can select a representative $s_i$ from each
class.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc3.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Once placed on the number line and assigned hats, any two prisoners will see
sequences that are eventually equal, with $t$ the sequence seen by the
prisoner further along (see above).
All prisoners can thus determine the equivalence class $S_i$ of the
actual sequence of hats, choose the corresponding representative
$s_i$, and output the guess $s_i(n)$ for their position $n$.
Since the actual sequence and the guess $s_i$ are eventually equal,
at most finitely many guesses are wrong.
$\blacksquare$
</div>

There are already a number of Feynman-like objections we could make
here; for instance, the prisoners need to have an infinitely large memory to store
the representatives $s_i$.
But even if we grant them these powers, what can they *do* with them?
Infinite memory is reminiscent of Maxwell's demon and relatives, so let us
replace the prisoners with *Zermelo's demon*, named after Ernst
Zermelo, originator of the AC.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
	   Prior to his work on set theory, Zermelo invented a demon to sit around
	   and wait for
	   [Poincaré recurrences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem).
	   These recurrences reset a system to its initial state, thereby spontaneously reducing entropy and violating
	   the second law of thermodynamics. We suppose Zermelo's demon got
	   bored—a recurrence takes much longer
	   than the age of the universe—and decided, like Zermelo, to turn its
	   efforts to mathematics.
	   </span>

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc4.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The demon uses AC and has a set of lucky coins; any time it
flips one, it learns the infinitely long history of prior coin
outcomes (analogous to prisoners looking backwards) and the number of
flips until the coin disintegrates (analogous to a prisoner learning their
number). Like the prisoners, the demon can determine the equivalence
class of $S_i$ of the history of flips, and choose the representative
$s_i$ with the AC. But since *any* sequence of remaining flips gives
rise to the same $s_i$, it's clear that the demon learns nothing about them!

The fact that Zermelo's demon cannot predict future coin flips makes
the AC less physically disturbing. But there is another variant due to
[Hardin and Taylor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27642415) which shows
the demon *can* look into the future. I follow
[this nice exposition](https://ericmoorhouse.org/handouts/Hardin-Taylor.pdf)
by Eric Moorhouse.

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Hardin-Taylor Theorem.</span>
Given an arbitrary function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, Zermelo's demon
can use the behaviour of $f$ on $(-\infty, t)$ to correctly predict the
behaviour on $(-\infty, t')$ for some $t' > t$, except for $t$ in a
countable set.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i> To prove this, the demon first constructs a
well-ordering<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
A well-ordering is a linear order ($\prec, A)$ such that every nonempty set of $A$ has a least
element. We use the AC to pick the least element,
then its successor, and so on.
</span>
$(\prec, \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}})$ on the set of real functions using the AC. 
Consider the equivalence relation on functions $f:
\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ given by
$$
f \sim_t g \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad f(x) = g(x) \text{ for all } x
< t.
$$
The well-ordering allows the demon to define the representative
$
\hat{f}_t = \min_{\prec} \{g : f \sim_t g\}.
$
The demon then guesses that $\hat{f}_t$ is the extension of $f$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 15px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc5.svg" width="350"/>
	</div>
	</figure>
	
This extrapolation will fail on some set of “unpredictable” times,
$$
U = \{t \in \mathbb{R} : \hat{f}_t \neq \hat{f}_{t'} \text{ for all }
t' > t\}.
$$
These are times for which $\hat{f}_t$ fails to agree with $f$ at all
$t' > t$, or equivalently, $\hat{f}_{t'}$.
Our goal now is to show the set $U$ is countable.
Observe that $U$ cannot have an infinite sequence of times, or
equivalently a sequence of functions,
$$t_1> t_2 > \cdots \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
\hat{f}_{t_1} \succ \hat{f}_{t_2} \succ \cdots,
$$
since $\hat{f}_{t_{i}} \sim_{t_{i+1}} f$, but $\hat{f}_{t_{i+1}}$
is defined as the minimal function satisfying this, so we must have $
\hat{f}_{t_{i}} \succ \hat{f}_{t_{i+1}} $. This
infinite descending sequence is impossible, since $U$ has a least
element.
Since $U$ has no infinite descending sequence of times, for any $t \in
U$, the set $U_t = U \cap (t, \infty)$ either has a least
element $\min U_t$, or is empty, in which case $t = \max U$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/aoc6.svg" width="330"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

In the first case, we can find a rational number $\iota(t)$ which is
between $t$ and $\min U_t$; in the second, we just choose some
rational $\iota(t) > t$. The map $\iota: U \to \mathbb{Q}$ is an
injection, and since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, $U$ is countable.
$\blacksquare$
</div>

The demon is clairvoyant on almost all intervals $(-\infty, t)$, but with no
guarantees about how long that clairvoyance can last. It would be
unwise to follow its investment advice! As with the lucky coins, the
demon's powers are useless or unreliable. In fact, all the variants discussed in Hardin and
Taylor's
[monograph](https://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~rmiller/abstracts/Hardin-Taylor.pdf)
have some similar fineprint; this illustrates the fundamentally
nonconstructive nature of the AC, where we can build something, but we
can't say when, where, or for how long.<label for="sn-1"

I think physics remains safe from Zermelo's demon.

## 3. <a href="#tbc">Why the sky is blue</a><a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

Why is the sky blue? The conventional answer is that light bounces off
air molecules, and high frequencies bounce more.
Blue has a high frequency, so voilà!
But actually, violet has a higher frequency, so why isn't the sky
violet?
It turns out the sun emits more blue light, so surely that does it?
[Do the calculation](https://hapax.github.io/physics/everyday/sky/),
and you find it doesn't. The sky should be green!
So what gives?
Ultimately, we need to know about physiology; it is the eye, and not
the sky, that is blue.
To carefully determine the perceived colour, we need to go and look up
[luminous efficiency functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function)
and [photopic vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision),
and do some integrals.
This is hard work, and I am lazy.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center; padding: 5px"><img src
    ="/img/posts/sky1.svg" width="430"/>
	</div>
</figure>

Luckily, there is a quick hack to get the right answer!
The basic idea is to assume that the eye adapted to be receptive to
sunlight, so as a first approximation, we can take its sensitivity
curve<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>

	   <span class="sidenote">
	   Aka photopic luminous efficiency function.
	   </span> $V$ to equal the spectral intensity $I_{\odot}$ of the sun.
But we also see diffuse illumination $I_{\text{diff}}(\nu)$ from
scattered light, so a more refined approximation is a weighted average,
$$
V = \alpha I_{\odot} + \beta I_{\text{diff}}
$$
for some $\alpha + \beta = 1$.
Let's see what color this predicts!

<div style="background-color: #202229 ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5; border-radius: 15px">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spectral Adaptation.</span>
If the eye adapts to a mixture of direct and diffuse sunlight with
weight $\alpha$, the peak frequency is
\[
h\nu^* = (7 - 2 \alpha) k_\text{B}T_{\odot},
\]
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $k_\text{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T_\odot$ is the
sun's temperature.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #16171c ; padding: 20px; border: 0px solid
grey; line-height:1.5">
<i>Proof.</i>
For frequency $\nu$ and temperature $T$, the blackbody spectrum is
proportional to
\[
I_{\odot}(\nu) \propto \frac{\nu^{3}}{e^{h\nu/k_\text{B}T_{\odot}} - 1} \propto \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}
\]
for a dimensionless variable $x = h\nu/k_\text{B}T_{\odot}$.
Rayleigh scattering increases with frequency as $\nu^{4}$, so
$I_{\text{diff}}(\nu) \propto \nu^4 I_{\odot}(\nu)$. Thus, for
weight $\alpha$, the sensitivity curve goes as
\[
V(\nu) = \alpha I_{\odot}(\nu) + (1- \alpha)I_{\text{diff}}(\nu) \propto \left[\alpha + (1-\alpha) x^4\right] \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1},
\]
since using the dimensionless variable ensures the constants of
proportionality are equal.
The perceived spectrum of the sky is $V(x)I_{\text{diff}}(x)$.
To find the peak of the spectrum, we differentiate with respect to $x$
and set to zero, yielding the equation
\[
(x + 2 \alpha - 7)e^{x} - 2 \alpha + 7 = 0.
\]
This is transcendental, but has <a
href="https://hapax.github.io/physics/everyday/sky/">approximate
solution</a> $x \approx 7 - 2 \alpha$. The corresponding frequency
peak for perceived spectrum of scattered light is then
\[
h\nu^* = (7 - 2 \alpha) k_\text{B}T_{\odot} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lambda^* = \frac{c}{\nu^*} = \frac{hc}{(7 - 2 \alpha) k_\text{B}T_{\odot}}
\]
as claimed. If we now plug in constants $hc/k_\text{B} = 14.4 \text{
mm K}$, the surface temperature of the sun $T_{\odot} = 5800 \text{ K}$,
and $\alpha = 0.85$ gives
\[
\lambda^* = \frac{14.4 \text{ nm}}{(7-2 \cdot 0.85)5800} \approx 470 \text{nm},
\]
only a few nanometres off the perceived color!

To identify this with the perceived color of the sky is a cheat for
two reasons. First, the "peak" of the spectrum depends on how we
parametrize it, and is different when we use spectral energy per unit
wavelength. Second, the sensitivity of the eye does not look like the
long-tailed blackbody distribution, but falls off much more quickly, so our adaptive
hypothesis is wrong.
Still, our hack works!

Interestingly, the sky isn't only blue during the day; it's sometimes
blue at night. Recently, on an evening drive I looked up and noticed a
