**December 2, 2023.** *A new blog.*

<div style="background-color: #212433 ; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid

Look at the pattern this seashell makes. The dappled whorl, curving
inward to infinity. That's the shape of the universe itself. There's a
constant pressure, pushing toward pattern. A tendency in matter to
evolve into ever more complex forms. It's a kind of pattern gravity, a
holy greening power we call <i>viriditas</i>, and it is the driving force in
the cosmos. Life, you see… <br>

<br>
And because we are alive, the universe
must be said to be alive. We are its consciousness as well as our
own. We rise out of the cosmos and we see its mesh of patterns, and it
strikes us as beautiful. And that feeling is the most important thing
in all the universe—its culmination, like the color of a flower at
first bloom on a wet morning. It’s a holy feeling, and our task in
this world is to do everything we can to foster it. <br>

My [old site](https://hapax.github.io/) got a bit cluttered with
stuff from my PhD, so I decided to reset with a new site and new
blog. I have some fun projects in the works which will hopefully
appear here soon.
