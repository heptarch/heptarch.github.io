**May 19, 2024.** *Solving hard technical problems via fundamental
  research requires a delicate balance of freedom and focus. I ponder how to
  establish and maintain this balance in a startup environment.*

The more I think about creative applied research, the more I feel that
my <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">last assay</a> at the subject
missed the mark.
I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development. I wish
that were true.
But many of the factors that made Bell a success---focus, mission,
creative and intellectual latitude---don't mean much unless they are
part of a job description.
Put differently, you can patch a bug or smash out a feature request
piecemeal, but no one is going to invent the transistor in their free time.
The required quanta of effort and attention are too large.

I think the only realistic option is to pay people to think about
these problems full time.
The two traditional approaches are academia and industrial
R&D. Universities are slower, clunkier, more inward-looking; industry
tends to be more constrained by revenue and other research-exogenous factors.
Neither path is ideal.
And while Bell had the best of both worlds, but its material circumstances are
unrepeatable. But there may be ways besides a state monopoly to enjoy
the merits of both Ivory Tower and boardroom.

Last time, I <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-5">discussed</a>
how to scale down some of the factors that made Bell Labs a success. I
suspect that open sourcing is scaling down too far. Instead, I
want to consider what this might look like in a small-to-medium size
startup.
I'll start with the easier problem of explaining what it looks like.
