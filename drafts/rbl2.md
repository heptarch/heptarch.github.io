**May 19, 2024.** *Solving hard technical problems via fundamental
  research requires a delicate balance of freedom and focus. I ponder how to
  establish and maintain this balance in a startup environment.*

The more I think about creative applied research, the more I feel that
my <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">last assay</a> at the subject
missed the mark.
I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development. I wish
that were true.
But many of the factors that made Bell a success---focus, mission,
creative and intellectual latitude---don't mean much unless they are
built into a job description.
Put differently, no one is going to invent the transistor in their
free time; the required quanta of effort and attention are too large.

I think the only realistic option is to pay people to think about
these problems full time.
The two traditional approaches are academia and industrial
R&D. Universities are slower, clunkier, more inward-looking; industry
tends to be more constrained by revenue and other research-exogenous factors.
Neither path is ideal.
And while Bell had the best of both worlds, its material circumstances are
unrepeatable. But there may be ways besides a state monopoly to enjoy
the merits of both the Ivory Tower and boardroom.

I suspect that open sourcing is scaling down too far. I'll consider
how we might realize the recipe in a small-to-medium size
startup. There are two key problems: (a) structure, and (b)
funding. Although these are related, I'll discuss them in turn.

Here's the elevator pitch. We have a bunch of hard, important, and unsolved
problems. They are unsolved because they are too commercial for
academics, on the one hand, and too far from turning a buck to
interest a business. They lie in that vein of creative applied
research the Bell mined so successfully.
So we copy the <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-5">recipe</a>:
hire a bunch of smart people, keep them happy, stimulated, and
focused, and get them to think in creative, free and interdisciplinary
ways about their problems.
That's what Bell did and it worked.

Of course, it's more complicated than that. We do a good problem domain; to be
richly connected, so there is a
