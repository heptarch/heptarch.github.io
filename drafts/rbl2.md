**May 19, 2024.** *Solving hard technical problems requires
  intellectual freedom, total focus, interdisciplinary random walks,
  and a finely-tuned coupling to reality. Here, I ponder how to
  establish and maintain these in a startup environment.*

Live in the future, then build what's missing.

Live in the future, find what's missing, and leave the rest to
the development team.

The more I think about creative applied research, the more I feel that
my <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">last assay</a> at the subject
missed the mark.
I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development, and I wish
that were true.
But the more I reflect on, and observe, how great research is done,
the more essential the component of immersion and near-continual focus
appear.
You can patch a bug or smash out a feature request after hours; the
require quanta of effort are small enough. But you are unlikely to
invent the transistor in your free time.
