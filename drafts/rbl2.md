**May 19, 2024.** *Bell Labs demonstrates that creative applied
  research requires a delicate balance of freedom and focus. I ponder
  how to establish and maintain this balance in a smaller environment.*

The more I think about creative applied research, the more I feel that
my <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">last assay</a> at the subject
was too optimistic.
I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development. I wish
that were true!
But many of the factors that made Bell a success---focus, mission,
creative and intellectual latitude---don't mean much unless they are
built into a job description.
Put differently, no one is going to invent the transistor in their
free time; the required quanta of effort and attention are too large.

I think the only realistic option is to pay people to think about
these problems full time.
The two traditional approaches are academia and industrial
R&D. Universities are slower, clunkier, more inward-looking and hidebound; industry
is more constrained by revenue and other research-exogenous factors.
Neither path is ideal.
And while Bell had the best of both worlds, its material circumstances are
unrepeatable.

But maybe you don't need a state monopoly to enjoy
the merits of both Ivory Tower and boardroom.
While open sourcing is scaling down too far, I'll consider
how we might realize the recipe in a small-to-medium size
startup or nonprofit.

## 1. <a href="#toc">Who: core team</a><a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

I'll lead in with a little elevator pitch. We have a bunch of hard, important, and unsolved
problems. Many remain unsolved not so much because they are hard, but
because they are too applied to interest a professor, and too far from turning a buck to
interest a CEO.<label for="sn-1"

</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   This may seem like a notrivial prior about problems, but it's
   supported by a simple empirical experiment: look at what people
   work on.
	   </span> They lie in the dead zone between academia and industry that Bell mined so successfully.
So it makes sense to emulate the <a
href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-5">Bell recipe</a>:
hire a bunch of smart people, put them in rooms with sunlight, keep
them stimulated, focused, and well-fed, and ultimately, by collaborative
management, get them to solve problems in creative and
interdisciplinary ways.
It worked for Bell.

We can flesh this out using the grade school strategy of "wh-" questions,
starting with "who". At Bell Labs, they hired scientists who could also
have gone on to good postdocs; I'm guessing that a flair for applied
research, a porousness to new ideas, and compatibility with existing
personnel, were also prerequisites.
In a smaller organization, research synergy with the rest of the team
is even more important.
