**May 19, 2024.** *In this post, I ponder how to perform creative
  applied research in a small (but not distributed) environment.*

<a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">Last time</a>, I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development. I wish
that were true!
But the more I think about it, the more it seems like many of the factors that made Bell a success---focus, mission,
creative and intellectual latitude---don't mean much unless they are
built into a job description.
Put differently, no one is going to invent the transistor in their
free time; the required quanta of effort and attention are too large.
The only realistic option is to pay people to think about
these problems full time.

The two traditional approaches are academia and industrial
R&D. Universities are slower, clunkier, more hidebound and inward-looking; industry
is more constrained by revenue and other research-exogenous factors.
Neither path is ideal.
And while Bell had the best of both worlds, its material circumstances are
unrepeatable.
But maybe you don't need a state monopoly to enjoy
the merits of both Ivory Tower and boardroom.
While open sourcing is scaling down too far, I'll consider
how we might realize the recipe in a startup or nonprofit.

## 1. <a href="#toc">Who: core-forward</a><a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

I'll lead in with a little elevator pitch. We have a bunch of hard, important, and unsolved
problems. Many remain unsolved not so much because they are hard, but
because they are too applied to excite a professor, and too far from turning a buck to
excite a CEO.<label for="sn-1"

</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   This may seem like a notrivial prior about problems, but it's
   supported by a simple empirical experiment: look at what people
   work on.
	   </span> The problems lie, in other words, in the dead zone between academia and industry that Bell mined so successfully.
Thus, it makes sense to emulate the <a
href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-5">Bell recipe</a>:
hire a bunch of smart people, put them in rooms with sunlight, keep
them stimulated, focused, and well-fed, and ultimately, by management
and judicious organizational structure, get them to solve problems in creative ways.
It worked for Bell.

We can flesh this out using the grade school strategy of "wh-" questions,
starting with "who". At Bell Labs, they hired scientists who could also
have gone on to good postdocs; I'm guessing that a flair for applied
research, a porousness to new ideas, and compatibility with existing
personnel, were prerequisites in addition to academic pedigree.

In a small-to-medium size organization for creative applied research,
the structure will be initially different, and the requirements will
change with it. Rather
than build out labs from the get-go, I suspect it is better to
develop a tight-knit *core team* of researchers with overlapping but
complementary areas of expertise, exemplary synergy, interdisciplinary
spirit, and the ability to make a killer
slide deck, i.e. to explain themselves clearly.
Each researcher may have a primary domain, but will be
radically attentive to the possibilities of overlap with other
domains, since <a
href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-4">combinatorics</a> and indeed
common sense favour the notion that new ideas live in the gap between
disciplines. Why should the universe obey our rules?

The goal of the core team is exploratory, not completist;
they sketch out the global shape of the problem space, things like technical
lacunae, points of intersection, roadblocks and avenues of attack. Although
they do not produce finished research, they need to be able to go
technically deep and take core samples<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

  Pun intended.
	   </span> of the problem space. Once the
core team reaches a threshold level of strategic clarity, some core
members will differentiate into "research leads", and start to build out the teams to pursue
these strategies. At this point, hiring might begin to look more like Bell.

That said, some core members should continue articulating the shape of
problem space, full-time, since that shape will change as new data
comes in. The individual research teams will not only be drilling core samples,
but expand those shafts into wells; they will feed their local data to
their core and get global data back.
To facilitate this, research leads should remain loosely coupled,
part-time members of the core.
The hope would be to replace superhuman managerial insight with a
natural flow of information between core, research leads, and teams.
Of course, the core itself will still require oversight and
leadership, which I'll get to below.

This approach is driven by a few different considerations.
First of all, that a concentric separation of concerns worked
for Bell; second, that a core radiating teams imparts a natural
structure and hierarchy to research management; finally, that it makes
interdisciplinary critical mass, animated by collaborative synergy,
the foundation of
