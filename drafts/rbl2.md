title: "Lessons from Bell Labs (Part 2)"

**February 6, 2024.** *This essay reflects on what made Bell Labs so
successful as an "institute of creative technology", why that success
has been so hard to replicate, and how one might attempt to replicate it in a distributed, self-organized, and rebellious fashion.*

In order to stress the continuity of procedures from research to
engineering of product into manufacture and to emphasize their real
unity, I speak of them as the single entity ‘organized creative technology’.

Bell Labs was a cool place. Over the course of a century, its researchers invented/discovered
lasers, the transistor, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, the Cosmic Microwave Background, electron diffraction, photovoltaic cells,
quality control, CCDs, optical fibres, `UNIX`, `C`, support
vector machines, the Fast Fourier Transform, Grover search,
and Shor's algorithm, among other innovations too numerous to name.
What made it special?
