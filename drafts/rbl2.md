**May 19, 2024.** *In this post, I ponder how to perform creative
  applied research in a small (but not distributed) environment.*

The more I think about creative applied research, the more it seems
my <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">last assay</a> was too optimistic.
I suggested that it might be possible to do great applied research in a
distributed fashion, like open source software development. I wish
that were true!
But many of the factors that made Bell a success---focus, mission,
creative and intellectual latitude---don't mean much unless they are
built into a job description.
Put differently, no one is going to invent the transistor in their
free time; the required quanta of effort and attention are too large.

I think the only realistic option is to pay people to think about
these problems full time.
The two traditional approaches are academia and industrial
R&D. Universities are slower, clunkier, more inward-looking and hidebound; industry
is more constrained by revenue and other research-exogenous factors.
Neither path is ideal.
And while Bell had the best of both worlds, its material circumstances are
unrepeatable.

But maybe you don't need a state monopoly to enjoy
the merits of both Ivory Tower and boardroom.
While open sourcing is scaling down too far, I'll consider
how we might realize the recipe in a small-to-medium size
startup or nonprofit.

## 1. <a href="#toc">Who: core-forward</a><a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

I'll lead in with a little elevator pitch. We have a bunch of hard, important, and unsolved
problems. Many remain unsolved not so much because they are hard, but
because they are too applied to interest a professor, and too far from turning a buck to
interest a CEO.<label for="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">
   This may seem like a notrivial prior about problems, but it's
   supported by a simple empirical experiment: look at what people
   work on.
	   </span> The problems lie, in other words, in the dead zone between academia and industry that Bell mined so successfully.
Thus, it makes sense to emulate the <a
href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-5">Bell recipe</a>:
hire a bunch of smart people, put them in rooms with sunlight, keep
them stimulated, focused, and well-fed, and ultimately, by management
and judicious organizational structure, get them to solve problems in creative ways.
It worked for Bell.

We can flesh this out using the grade school strategy of "wh-" questions,
starting with "who". At Bell Labs, they hired scientists who could also
have gone on to good postdocs; I'm guessing that a flair for applied
research, a porousness to new ideas, and compatibility with existing
personnel, were prerequisites in addition to academic pedigree.

In a small organization of creative applied research, I think
the mixture will be similar but the proportions will change. Rather
than build out labs from the get-go, I suspect it is better to
develop a tight-knit *core team* of researchers with overlapping but
complementary areas of expertise, exemplary synergy and openness to
new ideas, and the ability to make a killer
slide deck, i.e. to explain themselves clearly.
Each researcher will have their primary domain, but will be
radically attentive to the possibilities of overlap in
some secondary domains.
And <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/#sec-1-4">combinatorics
favours</a> the notion that new ideas live in the gap between
disciplines.

The goal of the core team is exploratory, not conclusive;
they sketch out the global shape of the problem space, the technical
lacunae, fruitful overlaps, roadblocks and avenues of attack, rather
than producing finished research. Once the
core team reaches a threshold level of strategic clarity, core
researchers partially decouple and start to build out the teams that will implement these
strategies. But the core remains partially coupled in case --- as
happens with the best-laid plans --- things go awry, or more
optimistically, there is something new to discover.

This "core-forward" approach is driven both by the logistics of hiring
as well as priors about how to solve problems. In particular, Bell's track record suggests that a
critical mass of interdisciplinary knowledge, animated by
collaborative synergy, is more effective than a single giant brain
in a vat. The brain can discover things, sure, but however
much it knows, it is less effective at research since it has less attention
to distribute. Discovery can and should be parallelized.
