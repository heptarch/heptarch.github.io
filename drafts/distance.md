**December 2, 2022.** *Humans are the measure of all things, though
  not in the sense Protagoras meant. I show how to estimate distance
  using only your hands and feet.*

The ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras famously stated that "man is the
measure of all things". He was also skeptical about whether math could
be applied to the real world, so it's unlikely he meant you could use
the human body to measure things. But you can! Famously, Galileo used
his pulse as a stopwatch. In this post, I'll point out a neat little
hack for estimating distance using only your hands and feet. If you
want to look eccentric and get better results, you can carry a clear
plastic ruler around instead.

So, consider a distant object you want to find the distance $d$ to.
Hold your hand out at a fixed distance from your eyes and fixed
orientation (e.g. horizontal), and estimate the size of the object in
fingers $f$.
(Practically speaking, you want to have an integer finger width.)
Your arm and hands form a triangle which is similar to the triangle
formed by the distant object:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/img/posts/anthrometry1" width="600"/>
	<figcaption><i>From Wikimedia Commons.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Now walk $s$ steps towards the object, so that it has integer finger
width $f'$.
