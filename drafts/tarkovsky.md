 Despatches from Florence <br>

<br>

Via di San Niccolò is a crabbed, serpentine network of alleys, wandering like the handwriting of a
drunken lover---at once
intimate and disorienting---across the parchment of the Oltrarno
quarter. It is a great favourite of locals; slyly regarding each other
over their amari, they watch from neighbouring bars as the sun sets
and shadows slink down the alleys and past the tower of San
Niccolò, that lonely and somnolent giant emerging
from the piazza Giuseppe Poggi. It is a place of secrets.
Let me show you one of them.

I spent the summer of 2012 as a student archivist at the Andrei
Tarkovsky International Institute, situated at 91 Via di San
Niccolò. I slept at the Institute, in a small room---more
a closet---next to the archives, ate at I Bastioni, and drank *branca menta*
once a week on my stipend. The Institute was opposite a perfumery.
In the evenings, the maestro attended his cauldron, and wafts of
opoponax, frankincense, rose, and osmanthus, of ambrette and musk, would
float into the closet and colour my dreams. I have never slept so
richly.

But the riches of Florence would recede as the Institute revealed its
great secret.
The Institute was little more than a disorganized repository of
the great director's final effects---books, journals, polaroids,
etc.---managed by his son Andrei and the ambiguous functionaries in his
employ.
Andrei was in Mykonos for the summer, and his instructions were so
garbled by intermediaries that, by the time they reached me, no one
could make sense of them.
One of the caretakers, Chiara, was a retired film theorist.
