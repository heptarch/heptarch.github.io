<b>THE SECRET PACT</b> <br>
<i>word and polaroids by Tun Casey</i> <br>

---

<!-- <span style="padding-left: 40px; display:block">
My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly, I
found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had
until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted
to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease. I felt
encountered and stimulated: someone was expressing what I had always
wanted to say without knowing how. Tarkovsky is for me the greatest,
the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it
captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.

I spent the summer of 1999 as a student archivist in Florence, at the Andrei
Tarkovsky International Institute. What follows is an account of my
time there which, for reasons both legal and moral, I was prevented from disclosing
until now.
CP, forgive me.

I. IN VIA DI SAN NICCOLÒ
  </p>

Via di San Niccolò is a crabbed, serpentine network of alleys, wandering like the handwriting of a
drunken lover <!-- ---at once intimate and disorienting--- -->
across the parchment of the Oltrarno
quarter. It is a great favourite of locals; slyly regarding each other
over their amari, they watch from neighbouring bars as the sun sets
and shadows slink down the laneways and past the tower of San
Niccolò, that lonely and somnolent giant emerging
from the piazza Giuseppe Poggi. It is a place of secrets.
Come, let me show you one of them.

The Andrei
Tarkovsky International Institute was situated at 91 Via di San
Niccolò. I slept at the Institute, in a small room—more
a closet—on the second floor, ate at I Bastioni, and drank <i>branca menta</i>
once a week on my stipend. The Institute was opposite a perfumery.
In the evenings, the maestro stirred his cauldron, and wafts of
opoponax, frankincense, rose and osmanthus, of ambrette and musk, would
float into the closet and colour my dreams. I have never slept so
richly. But the riches of Florence would soon recede into the
background and others take their place.

The Institute was like a scene from one of Tarkovsky's films,
cluttered as it was with his last effects---dried chrysanthemums, polyhedra in
birch and argilite, etchings by
Leonardo, letters to Antonioni and Bergman, his spectral
polaroids---and which could be found in odd places around the house, in
little stacks under the cupboards, say, or inside the fuse box, as if they
were alive and exploring the house.

The Institute's crowning treasure, however, was the "Martyrolog", diaries spanning the
period from the making of *Solaris* in 1970 until Tarkovsky's death in 1986.
These were carefully administered by his son, Andrei, but he was away
in Mykonos for the summer with the Institute's director, Andrea Ulivi,
and they had relayed instructions through
a sequence of intermediaries. I spoke with two
assistants in rapidfire Florentine, a
bibulous semiotician, Sven Nykvist's son, and various
dabblers and aesthetes who had no other occupation, it seemed, than to hang around
Via di San Niccolò and spread gossip.
Eventually, I understood I was to catalogue and assess the
scholarly interest of an unpublished portion of the Martyrolog, kept in a filing cabinet in a locked room on
the fourth floor.
The caretaker would give me the keys, and at the end of the
summer, I would share my findings with Andrei and/or Andrea, at least
one of whom would be back in Florence.

The "caretaker" turned out to be a gaunt woman called Chiara Pontieri who smoked
incessantly and was never to be found at the Institute.
She appeared in the kitchen on the evening of a full moon,
unannounced, two weeks into my stay, and
wordlessly poured us two glasses of sambuca on ice.
While the liquid clouded over, she stretched one leg onto the table,
lit a cigarette, and smiled: "Ne avrai bisogno."<label for="sn-1"

<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-1"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
	   <span class="sidenote">"You'll need it." (<i>It.</i>)</span>
From a leather satchel, she produced a slip of paper printed with the
Institute's letterhead and some serial numbers.
Chiara watched intently as I signed and dated the slip, then stubbed
out her cigarette, drained her sambuca and withdrew two keys from the
satchel: a heavy, single-toothed barrel key, acid etched "C3", and a
Schlage marked "May 79" for the filing cabinet.
She left as abruptly as she had arrived.
I found myself alone with the smell of anise and an odd feeling that the
moon was laughing at me, invisibly, far above.

II. THE ARK OPENS
</p>

I set to work enthusiastically the next morning, and after several
espressi, bounded up the staircase to the door marked "Camera No. 3 - мартирология".<label for="sn-3"

<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-3"

	   <span class="sidenote">"Martyrology" (<i>Rus.</i>) </span>
I paused in awe
at the threshold;
after two aimless weeks in Via di San Niccolò, the
curtains of the ark had parted to offer a glimpse of something
forbidden, something sacred.
But religious feeling is not proper to archival science, and as Jacob von Rammingen reminds us, without a registry "not
even the highest rule of divine nature can exist."<label for="sn-2"

I unlocked Camera No. 3 to find a state of picturesque chaos. At the
front of the room, a desk covered in postcards, sketches, letters,
newspaper clippings, and binders of official
documents and tax reports.
At the back, boxes stuffed with loose sheets of foolscap, a pair of
empty cupboards, and row upon row of filing cabinets labelled by month---the
reliquaries of the martyr.

<!--But the moment of sobriety on the threshold had dulled my hopes for a revelation.-->
May 1979 is a fallow month in the English version of Tarkovsky's
diaries,<label for="sn-4"

       id="sn-4"

	   with only two entries (May 12 and 22).
They are mostly concerned with the
promotion of *Stalker* and his plans to
leave for Italy.
<!--
In my first two weeks, I had browsed the Institute's archival
notes---a confusion of Russian,
Polish, Italian and French---which suggested that, while the diary
entries were elsewhere,-->
I thought that, at best, the May 79 cabinet would house correspondence with the Italian
authorities or Mosfilm; they might bore the average reader, but prove invaluable to the
biographer, the film critic, and the cultural materialist.
I would ask Chiara for more keys, draw provenance diagrams,
create accession numbers and EADs, and finish my
summer by changing hats and penning an editorial recommendation.

Borges states that the aesthetic phenomenon is "the imminence of a
revelation that does not yet occur".<label for="sn-5"

	   <span class="sidenote">“La Muralla y los Libros”, Jorge Luis
	   Borges (1961).</span>
Despite my archival sobriety, that moment---before the cabinet opened,
in that forbidden room, with its aura of genius, of mystery, of
possibilias transmuted by contact with the real---is one of
the great aesthetic experiences of my life.
I scanned the cabinets for "May 79", inserted the Schlage, and turned
it with a dull click.

III. THE CABINET OF MAY 79
</p>

The drawer opened to reveal a few scraps of paper and a pile of ash. I
removed it and carefully placed it on the floor to get a better sense
of its arrangement.
