I. IN VIA DI SAN NICCOLÒ
  </p>

Via di San Niccolò is a crabbed, serpentine network of alleys, wandering like the handwriting of a
drunken lover <!-- ---at once intimate and disorienting--- -->
across the parchment of the Oltrarno
quarter. It is a great favourite of locals; slyly regarding each other
over their amari, they watch from neighbouring bars as the sun sets
and shadows slink down the laneways and past the tower of San
Niccolò, that lonely and somnolent giant emerging
from the piazza Giuseppe Poggi. It is a place of secrets.
Let me show you one of them.

<p align="left">I spent the summer of 2012 as a student archivist at the Andrei
Tarkovsky International Institute, situated at 91 Via di San
Niccolò. I slept at the Institute, in a small room—more
a closet—on the second floor, ate at I Bastioni, and drank <i>branca menta</i>
once a week on my stipend. The Institute was opposite a perfumery.
In the evenings, the maestro stirred his cauldron, and wafts of
opoponax, frankincense, rose and osmanthus, of ambrette and musk, would
float into the closet and colour my dreams. I have never slept so
richly. But the riches of Florence would soon recede into the
background and others take their place.</p>

The Institute itself was aclutter with
the great director's last effects---dried chrysanthemums, polyhedra in
birch and argilite, etchings by
Leonardo, letters to Antonioni and Bergman, his spectral
polaroids---and could be found in odd places around the house, in
little stacks under the cupboards, say, or inside the fuse box, as if they
were alive and exploring.
The Institute's crowning treasure, however, was the "Martyrlog", diaries spanning the
period from the making of *Solaris* in 1970 until Tarkovsky's death in 1986.
These were carefully administered by his son, Andrei, but he was away
in Mykonos for the summer and had relayed instructions to me through
a sequence of intermediaries. I spoke with two
assistants in rapidfire Florentine, a
bibulous semiotician, Sven Nykvist's son, and various
dabblers and aesthetes who had no other occupation, it seemed, than to hang around
Via di San Niccolò and spread gossip.
Eventually, I understood I was to organize, evaluate, and possibly digitize an
unpublished portion of the Martyrlog, kept in a locked room on
the fourth floor.
The caretaker would give me the keys, and at the end of the
summer, I would report to a professor of Polish literature in Warsaw.

The "caretaker" was a thin, ungainly woman called Chiara who smoked
constantly and was never to be found at the Institute.
She appeared in the kitchen on the evening of a full moon,
unannounced, two weeks into my stay, and
wordlessly poured us two glasses of sambuca.
While the water clouded over, she stretched one leg onto the table and
smiled: "Ne avrai bisogno."<label for="sn-1"

Chiara watched intently as I signed and dated a slip, then drained her
sambuca and handed me two keys: a heavy, single-toothed barrel key for the
room itself, and a Schlage for the filing cabinet I was to
have access to.
She left as abruptly as she had arrived.
I found myself alone with the smell of anise and a feeling that the
moon was laughing invisibly, far above.

II. THE LOCKED ROOM
</p>

After two aimless weeks in Via di San Niccolò, two weeks of perfume,
*branca menta*, and sunset rambles through Florence, a door would open.
I set to work the next morning.
