Via di San Niccol√≤ is a crabbed network of alleys, at once
intimate and disorienting, which wanders like the handwriting of a
drunken lover over the parchment of Florence. It is a great favourite
of locals, who slyly regard each other over their amari, from
neighbouring bars, as the sun sets and shadows lengthen. It is a place
of secrets.
