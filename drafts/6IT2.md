title: "Six Impossible Things: Issue 2"
short: "6IT1"
date:  2024-03-25

**March 17, 2024.** *In the first issue of 6IT: the mathematics of supervising children; unreliably clairvoyant demons; why the sky is blue
(and why it isn't); a Poisson process for primes; sychronizing
fireflies; and quantum error correction from Penrose tilings.*

“There's no use trying, ” she said. “One can't believe impossible things.”
“I daresay you haven't had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”<br>

Inspired by one of my heroes, [John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html), I'm
planning to blog about "finds" in the hard sciences on a semi-regular basis. These
may be papers, favourite theorems, new discoveries, or shower thoughts; I'm hoping to
be brief and nerdily enthusiastic rather than thorough and technically
deep. Either way, I hope it's fun to read. Let's see how it goes!
