**December 6, 2022.** *Maxwell's demon *

## Introduction
---

Maxwell's demon is a tiny hypothetical imp that can separate fast- and
slow-moving particles in a gas. This decreases entropy ("disorder")
and thus apparently violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Concrete proposals either fail to work when thermal fluctuations are
taken into account (e.g. hinged flaps), or have a hidden entropic
cost which preserves the Second Law.
