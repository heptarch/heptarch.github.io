**December 6, 2022.** *Maxwell's demon *

## Introduction
---

Maxwell's demon is a tiny hypothetical imp that can separate fast- and
slow-moving particles of a gas into two different chambers. Bennett's
demon is a special case where the demon computes *reversibly* and
therefore generates no entropy cost.
This appears to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, up to a
cunning proviso.
Each time it sorts a particle, it generates a single bit of data,
which it can either remember or forget.
Forgetting costs thermodynamic entropy $k_BT \ln 2$, where $T$ is the
temperature of the demon's memory unit, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's
constant.
Remembering, on the other hand, has a memory cost, and cannot be
sustained indefinitely.
What kind of constraints does this produce?

What do constraints on physical memory tell us about reversibly
computed violations of the Second Law?
