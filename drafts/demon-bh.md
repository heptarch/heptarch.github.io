**December 6, 2022.** *Maxwell's demon *

## Introduction
---

Maxwell's demon is a tiny hypothetical imp that can separate fast- and
slow-moving particles in a gas. This decreases entropy ("disorder")
and thus apparently violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Concrete proposals either fail to work when thermal fluctuations are
taken into account (e.g. hinged flaps), or have a hidden entropy
cost which ultimately preserves the Second Law.
Landauer argued that erasing one bit (dissipating it irreversibly into
the environment) always comes with an entropy cost of $k_BT \ln 2$, where
the environment has temperature $T$ and

$$
k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ m}^2\text{ kg s}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-1}
$$

is *Boltzmann's constant*.
