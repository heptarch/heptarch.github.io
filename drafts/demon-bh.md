**December 6, 2022.** *Maxwell's demon *

## Introduction
---

Maxwell's demon is a tiny hypothetical imp that can separate fast- and
slow-moving particles in a gas. By increasing order, it decreases
entropy, and apparently violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
which says that (up to microscopic fluctuations) entropy always
decreases.
