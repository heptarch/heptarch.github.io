**November 9, 2022.** *I'll explain what Parrondo's paradox is, and why it
  isn't a paradox, using the convenient language of quantum mechanics.*

## Introduction

Sometimes, alternating between two losing strategies becomes a winning
strategy. This is called *Parrondo's paradox*. As we'll see, it isn't
much of a paradox, but it is interesting, particularly due to its
connection to thermodynamics.
To illustrate, consider a molecule sitting in a hot bath.
It will bump into other particles and jump around randomly.
If it's subject to gravity and sitting on an even slope $E$, it will gradually
slide down, albeit with random jumps back and forth.

Instead of an even slope, we could imagine something jagged, which still
tilts to the left overall. The molecule may get stuck in a local
divot, or it may drift to the left.
What it cannot do, however, is drift to the right.

Suppose that it did. Then we would be turning thermal energy---the
random jumps---into gravitational potential energy. This violates the
Second Law of thermodynamics, which forbids us turning thermal energy
into useful work.
To be clear, each time the particle jumps to the right, we seem to
have violated the Second Law, but really, what matters is the
*average*.
Random fluctuations are fine, but the average trajectory must always
get stuck or go left.

Suppose we can press
