**November 9, 2022.** *I'll explain what Parrondo's paradox is, and why it
  isn't a paradox, using the convenient language of quantum mechanics.*

## Introduction

Sometimes, alternating between two losing strategies becomes a winning
strategy. This is called *Parrondo's paradox*. As we'll see
shortly, it isn't much of a paradox, but it is interesting.
A simple illustration is a ball rolling around some hills. Maybe the
ball is hot, and has the tendency to jump randomly, but its average
behaviour is easy to understand.
