**November 9, 2022.** *I'll explain what Parrondo's paradox is, and why it
  isn't a paradox, using the convenient language of quantum mechanics.*

## Introduction

Sometimes, alternating between two losing strategies becomes a winning
strategy. This is called *Parrondo's paradox*. As we'll see, it isn't
much of a paradox, but it is interesting, particularly due to its
connection to thermodynamics.
To illustrate, consider a molecule sitting in a hot bath.
It will bump into other particles and jump around randomly.
If it's sitting on a slope, on
