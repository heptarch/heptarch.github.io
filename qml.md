I'm a quantum machine learning (QML) researcher in Maria Schuld's
group at [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/). I'm interested in the
interplay between quantum algorithms, statistical learning theory, and
symmetry. I also run our [QML journal club](https://heptar.ch/qml-jc).

## Quantum computing

A few questions I'm thinking about right now:

- Using simple noise models and complexity-theoretic tools, can we
  characterize the limitations of NISQ devices for Hamiltonian
  simulation?
- What is the link between Grover search and the quantum limit?
- Are there ways to parametrize signal-processing and metrological
  techniques to optimize, e.g. energy estimation protocols on ISQ/EFT devices?
- How can we leverage the Shor's algorithm (and the Hidden Subgroup
Problem more generally) for deep learning?
- Can we use stabilizer states for distributed protocols?
- Is there a parlance connecting quantum circuits and
measurement-based quantum computation?
- Is monosemanticity naturally formulated in quantum terms?
