I'm a quantum machine learning (QML) researcher in Maria Schuld's
group at [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/). I'm interested in the
interplay between quantum algorithms, statistical learning theory, and
symmetry. I also run our
[QML journal club](https://heptar.ch/qml-jc).

Prior to joining Xanadu,
I did a PhD in [high energy physics](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1868975).

## Quantum computing

Some quantum computing problems I'm thinking about right now:

- Using simple noise models and complexity-theoretic tools, can we
  characterize the limitations of NISQ devices for Hamiltonian
  simulation?
- What is the link between Grover search and the Heisenberg limit?
- Are there ways to parametrize signal-processing and metrological
  techniques to optimize, e.g. energy estimation protocols on ISQ/EFT devices?
- How can we leverage Shor's algorithm (and the Hidden Subgroup
Problem more generally) to design learning algorithms? What is the corresponding
inductive bias?
- Can we use stabilizer states for distributed computing protocols?
- What common syntax connects quantum circuits and
measurement-based computation?
- Can monosemanticity/sparse autoencoding of LLM be usefully formulated as a
  quantum post-processing layer?

## Miscellaneous

Some other problems I'm thinking about:

- Is it possible to extract the arrow of time from a Euclidean path
integral?
- Are there quantum versions of algorithmic conservation of
  randomness?
- Can we recast higher-moment versions of the Eigenstate Thermalization
  Hypothesis (ETH) in terms of pseudorandom states, quantum money, and/or
  error correction?
- What is the computational complexity of forming soap bubbles?
