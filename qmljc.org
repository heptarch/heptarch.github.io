* QML journal club
This is the informal home page for Xanadu's quantum machine learning
journal club (QMLJC).
We will be reading through Dan Roberts and Sho Yaida's textbook,
[*The Principles of Deep Learning Theory*](https://deeplearningtheory.com/).
The hope is that, by grokking a physics-informed approach to classical
ML, we can see what, if anything, transfers to quantum ML.
Here is the upcoming schedule:
