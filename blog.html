		  <h3>Introduction</h3>
		  <p>Welcome! This post outlines a preliminary vision
            for a Bell Labs-style "idea collider", focused on
            solving the world's most challenging problems and
            bringing innovations that benefit all. This sounds
            ambitious, and it is. But I'll try to argue that Bell
            Labs offers a precedent that can plausibly  be
            adapted from a 19th century state monopoly to a
            21st century startup.</p>
		  
		  <h3>Three ways</h3>
                    <p>First, let's ask the question: what is best way
                    to solve real-world
            problems in science and technology? Broadly
            speaking, there are
            two approaches. The first is
            academic. It occurs in universities, and is funded by
            grants to (often tenured or tenure-track) principal
            investigators. These investigators may
            be part of larger collaborations, consortia, or research
            initiatives. But since hiring and funding tend to reward
            individual publication metrics, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's
                    Law</a> tells us that these will be
                    maximized. The focus on individual publication
                    record leads to siloing and an
            obvious bias against work which is practical, messy,
		  or heuristic, thereby precludes
                    advances on concrete problems in the real world.
		  </p> <br>

		  <p>
	    The second approach is private enterprise. In principle, this
	    is better placed to solve messy problems,
	    since a for-profit operation can command
	    more capital, has strong incentives against siloing, and
	    must yield practical outcomes if it hopes to survive. But
	    here Goodhart's Law cuts even deeper, since the pressure to
	    generate revenue limits research horizons and
	    timelines. Solutions may well be
	    profitable, but are likely to be suboptimal, both from the
	    research perspective and that of distributive fairness.
</p><br>

<p>
Is there a way to enjoy the benefits of both? Industrial-academic
partnerships are one option, but since these involve two parties
operating under separate constraints, it is some ways the <i>worst</i>
of both worlds rather than  the best. (Naturally, there are exceptions.) More promising,
perhaps, is the
industrial R&D lab.
These vary widely in scope, operation, and profit motive; we'll focus
on the "blue sky" efforts which lie
in the tail of the innovation distribution. The goal here is usually
major competitive advantage from an unexpected breakthrough, but
because these breakthroughs are rare, blue sky research is risky and
usually only attempted by larger companies which can absorb the possible losses.
Modern examples range from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">Skunkworks
projects</a> of the aerospace sector to the
 <a href="https://x.company/">moonshot factories</a> of Big Tech.</p>

<h3>The Bell Labs recipe</h3>

<p>
However innovative these modern exemplars, history shows a clear outlier: Bell Labs. After Alexander
Graham Bell invented the telephone in the 1870s, he formed a company to develop a
continental telephone system for the United States. Constructing the national
infrastructure for a new technology, from scratch, naturally required
a research division to solve the many questions that arose. By the mid-20th
century, this research division—Bell Labs—had became the largest and most productive industrial 
research facility in the world.
</p><br>

<p>
Let's reel off a few of its successes: the
transistor, the laser, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>UNIX</tt>, photovoltaic cells,
quality control, information theory, modern cryptography,
error-correcting codes, support vector machines, charged couple
devices, radio astronomy, electron diffraction, optical fibres, and the
Fast Fourier Transform, to name a few. No other R&D lab in history
boasts so many Nobels, Turing awards, or IEEE prizes. No other lab touches so many branches of fundamental and applied science. It didn't
invent the US telephone system; it invented the 20th century.
</p><br>

<p>
In the '00s, Bell began to crumble—undermined by its own
inventions—and Bell Labs crumbled with it. We'll ask why it failed
below, but first: why was it was so successful for so long? It's easy
to point to the monopoly, or the telephone system itself, but I
think it was due to a number of factors:</p><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Domain.</b> The lab was embedded in a problem-rich domain of application.</li>
  <li><b>Mandate.</b> The lab was required to effectively solve the problems in this
  domain.</li>
  <li><b>Freedom.</b> Researchers had freedom to pursue and initiate
  research projects connected to the domain.</li>
  <li><b>Stability.</b> Researchers did not have to apply for funding,
  and were encouraged to think long-term.</li>
  <li><b>Interaction.</b> The environment was deliberately
  collaborative and interdisciplinary.</li>
  <li><b>Separation.</b> Research was strictly separated from
  development/product, ensuring total focus.</li>
  <li><b>Feedback.</b> Results from the domain, including
  development/product, fed back into research.</li>
  <li><b>Talent.</b> The lab hired researchers of high academic
  calibre who were a good cultural fit. </li>
  <li><b>Structure.</b> Managers and executives collaboratively
  enable all of the above.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>
You can read more about why I selected these factors <a href="https://heptar.ch/rbl1/">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Monopoly isn't enough</h3>

<p>
A state monopoly with a broad infrastructural mandate helped realize
each of the factors above, but wasn't strictly
necessary.
It seems clear that, at least in principle, Big Tech could do it
today. But while subsidiaries like <a
href="https://x.company/">Google <tt>X</tt></a> work on "blue sky",
high-impact projects, they are cartoonishly divorced from Google's operational
concerns and, it seems, designed by committee in advance. They are
neither adequately coupled nor adequately free.
</p><br>

<p>
So why don't we see Bell Labs everywhere in Big Tech? The answer is
probably that, by sharing its innovations, Bell Labs put itself out of
business, and Big Tech very much wants to stay in business. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind">DeepMind</a> is a
case in point. Formed in the UK in 2010, the company did groundbreaking
work in AI and reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of games, culminating in AlphaGo's
defeat of Lee Sedol in 2015. DeepMind was acquired by Google the year before,
and <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-unit-deepmind-triedand-failedto-win-ai-autonomy-from-parent-11621592951">despite
its bids for autonomy</a>, was recently merged with Google Brain to form
Google DeepMind. Its focus has now almost entirely shifted
away from the open, heterogenous AI research that made it famous,
to closed R&D for large language models like Gemini.
This reflects Google's frantic struggle to catch up in the language
model arms race.
</p><br>

<p>
DeepMind could be given a long leash when times were good, but once
executives started to panic, blue sky
became a luxury the company couldn't afford.
This clearly  shows the value of a monopoly for industrial
research: it stops the market from spilling into
the laboratory. But if a giant like Google—which, according to the US
Department of Justice, <i>does</i> have a monopoly—can't manage it, how can
anyone else?
</p>

<h3>Everything in its right place</h3>
<p>
There is a subtle difference between Bell Labs and DeepMind which
suggests that corporate governance and organizational structure are
more important than monopoly per se.
DeepMind was acquired as an unprotected asset that could later be mined for talent; Bell
Labs was operationally essential from the beginning and so operationally
protected until the end. In terms of our criteria, DeepMind
fails the requirement of mandate, and Google that of structure.
</p><br>

<p>
Another cautionary tale is OpenAI. With its track-record of <a
href="https://x.com/sama/status/1663983687241744393?lang=en">"repeatable
innovation"</a> and cross-disciplinary insight, it may be the closest modern analogue of Bell Labs. The company <a
href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/">started out</a> as a
non-profit entity whose goal was to research AI, safely, independently, and openly, for the good of
all humanity. I would guess that it initially  ticked
our boxes. But it has seemingly become a victim of its own success,
transitioning, after the release of ChatGPT, to a closed, capped-profit entity enmeshed with
Microsoft. This might have left the
research culture intact for all I know, but the ongoing exodus of senior
figures suggests otherwise.
</p><br>

<p>Time will tell whether these changes are in fact necessary for the company
to achieve its mission. The point is that, either way, the
initial structure could not bear the weight of ChatGPT's unexpected
commercial success. At Bell, the research had a commercial outlet from
the beginning; there was no need to choose between open, non-profit
research and closed, for-profit product, because the two already
existed in distinct places. 
</p>

<h3>The virtuous cycle</h3>

<p>
The history of Bell, Google and OpenAI suggest that, for repeatable
innovation and long-term success, the industrial lab ("Research") should be paired
from the outset with a commercial wing ("Product").
Product supplies capital and contact with the problem domain, and
receives the mature outcomes of Research in return. This arrangement can only work
on the culturally- and institutionally-enforced understanding that
Product does not interfere with Research.
</p><br>

<p>
To get the ball rolling, there needs to be something for Product to
commercialize, and Research to understand, analogous to the telephone
system at Bell or the transformer at OpenAI. I propose
three projects:
</p><br>
<ol>
  <li><b><tt>StateCraft</tt>.</b> A high-level functional language for
  quantum programming.</li>
  <li><b>Invisible Ink.</b> A tool for watermarking large language models
  at both training and output stages.</li>
  <li><b>Paχ.</b> A partially centralized cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol><br>

<p>
Each project couples a research mandate to a product; in turn, the
projects are in overlapping domains and lend themselves to
cross-disciplinary sequels. The goal of <b>Redshift</b> is to
implement these initial projects and see if our expectations pan
out. If so, we hone the methodology, scale up, and hope to become a
Bell Labs-style center for repeatable innovation and creative applied
research. And by honing culture, structure, and corporate governance, I think we can avoid the
issues that plague blue sky innovation in Big Tech.</p><br>
