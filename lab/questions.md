I'm excited to work with people who can combine imaginative play with
      technical excellence, and love to solve difficult
      problems.
	  The questions below are an informal means of probing those qualities.
	  If you'd like to work with me on a project (either from
      [`Rebel Labs`](https://heptar.ch/lab/) or something else),
      answering one or two of these questions will help give me a
      sense of "research compatibility".

Please send answers to [`7@heptar.ch`](mailto: 7@heptar.ch).

1. You have a pile of warm metal shavings in the shape of a
      cone. Discuss.
2. How can a two-level quantum system be used as a gyroscope?
3. In the sewer beneath the Prague Orloj is a locked box. What is inside?
4. Intelligent life evolves from topologically robust quantum matter. Describe its social
    structure and language.
5. You control a Dyson sphere around a Kerr black hole. A cat
    falls in. Can you learn its mass, angle
    and time of infall from gravitational waves hitting the
      sphere.
6. What do you find most interesting about the number $17$?
7. What is time? What has it got to do with thermodynamics? Why
      is it one-dimensional?
8. George Box said "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
    Is this a model?
