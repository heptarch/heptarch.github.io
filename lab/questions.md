I'm excited to work with people who can combine imaginative play with
      technical excellence, and are excited to solve difficult
      problems.
	  These questions are designed to probe those qualities.
	  If you'd like to work on a project (either from
      [`Rebel Labs`](https://heptar.ch/lab/) or something else),
      answering one or two of these questions will help give me a
      sense of "research compatibility".

1. You have a pile of warm metal shavings in the shape of a
      cone. Discuss.
2. How can a two-level quantum system be used as a gyroscope?
3. In the sewer beneath the Prague Orloj is a locked box. What is inside?
4. Intelligent life evolves from topologically robust quantum matter. Describe its social
    structure and language.
5. You control a Dyson sphere around a Kerr black hole. A cat
    falls in. Explain how to reconstruct its mass, angle
    and time of infall from gravitational waves impinging on the
      sphere.
6. What do you find most interesting about the number $17$?
7. What is time? What has it got to do with thermodynamics? Why
      is it one-dimensional?
8. George Box said "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
    Is this a model?
